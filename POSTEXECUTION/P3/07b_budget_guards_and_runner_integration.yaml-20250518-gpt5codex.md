# Phase 3 Post-Execution â€“ Budget guards and runner integration

## Test Summary
- `pytest codex/code/integrate_budget_guards_runner_p3/tests -q`
  - All 11 tests passed covering trace emitter, budget math, manager lifecycle, and FlowRunner integration scenarios.

## Coverage & Behaviour Notes
- TraceEventEmitter verified for immutability and sink forwarding; no mutation leaks observed.
- BudgetManager history lookup validated after scope exit, ensuring diagnostic inspection persists beyond execution.
- FlowRunner propagates `PolicyViolationError` with accompanying trace payloads while stopping on node-level budget breaches and warning on soft run budgets.

## Follow-ups
- Consider bridging PolicyStack `policy_resolved` events into the shared emitter when schema validation tooling is available.
- Extend tests to cover nested loop scopes and combined policy + budget breaches in future phases.
