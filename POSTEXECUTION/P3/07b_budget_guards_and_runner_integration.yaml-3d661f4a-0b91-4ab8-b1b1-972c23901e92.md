# Phase 3 Post-Execution â€” Budget Guards & Runner Integration

## Test Results
- `pytest codex/code/phase3-budget-runner-71d5/tests -q`

## Coverage & Notes
- Unit suite exercises BudgetManager preview/commit branches, including hard-stop propagation and soft-warning traces.
- FlowRunner tests cover run-level breaches and loop soft-warn scenarios, validating trace emission and stop reasoning.
- TraceEmitter tests confirm immutable payload guarantees and policy bridge integration.
- No additional integration harness was required; adapters rely on deterministic in-memory fakes.
