# Phase 3 Post-execution Summary — Task 07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration

## Test Results
- `pytest codex/code/work/tests -q`
  - Status: ✅ Passed (see chunk `fb1dad`)

## Coverage & Quality Notes
- BudgetManager tests exercised both preflight and commit paths, including soft/hard divergence and unknown scope handling.
- FlowRunner integration tests validated stop reasons, policy events, and trace emission.
- Additional property-based coverage for metric normalisation remains a recommended enhancement.

## Follow-ups
- Align simplified PolicyStack with production DSL policy module to ensure parity in trace schema fields.
- Expand telemetry assertions once the runner integrates with the canonical trace schema validators.
