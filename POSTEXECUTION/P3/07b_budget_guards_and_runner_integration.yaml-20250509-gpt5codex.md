# Post-Execution Summary â€“ Phase 3

## Test Results
- `pytest codex/code/work/tests -q`
  - Outcome: PASS
  - Notes: Validated cost normalisation, budget manager semantics, and runner integration including loop stop handling.

## Coverage & Quality Notes
- Manual inspection confirms budget warnings are de-duplicated via `consume_warnings`.
- Trace ordering retains `run_end` as terminal event while preserving `budget_breach` payloads.
- Adapter doubles enforce deterministic estimate/execute cycle; no external side effects observed.

## Follow-ups
- Consider integrating TraceEvent schema validation from shared spec modules.
- Expand FlowRunner to cover decision/fallback branches once policy stack work from Phase 2 is merged.
