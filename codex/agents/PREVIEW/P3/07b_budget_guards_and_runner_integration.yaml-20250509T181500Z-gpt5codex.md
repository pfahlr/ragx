# Phase 3 Preview â€“ Budget guards and runner integration

## Highlights
- Added regression coverage for loop scope stops and policy-denial precedence, ensuring FlowRunner behaviour is driven by failing tests first.
- Extended `FlowRunner` with loop scope orchestration, policy trace bridging, and structured loop summary emission while preserving adapter-driven execution.
- Hardened existing unit tests with missing imports to keep the suite runnable for subsequent phases.

## Planned Validation
- `pytest codex/code/work/tests/test_flow_runner_budget_integration.py -q`
- `pytest codex/code/work/tests/test_flow_runner_loops.py -q`
- `pytest codex/code/work/tests -q`
