title: Milvus Adapter
description: >
  Out-of-process adapter that maps our IndexSpec and search API onto Milvus via gRPC.
  Supports add/search and best-effort serialize/export.
assumptions:
  - Local Milvus not required in CI; provide mock client and recorded fixtures.
steps:
  - Implement client adapter translating build/add/search to Milvus.
  - Map metric/kind params; expose collection/index creation.
  - Provide offline mocks for CI; live integration behind env flag.
tests:
  - file: tests/unit/test_milvus_mapping.py
    purpose: Spec-to-params mapping and request formatting.
  - file: tests/e2e/test_milvus_adapter_offline.py
    purpose: Run adapter against mocked service; parity with core Search schema.
