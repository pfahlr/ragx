title: Toolpacks Tests â€” Completeness
description: >
  Add regression and property tests covering $ref resolution, duplicate ids,
  missing fields, cache immutability, and nondeterministic bypass.
goals:
  - Unit tests for loader edge cases: nested $ref, duplicate ids, missing fields.
  - Executor tests for cache deepcopy and nondeterministic packs.
  - Property tests with hypothesis for schema validation.
deliverables:
  - tests/unit/test_toolpacks_loader.py (expanded)
  - tests/unit/test_toolpacks_exec_python.py (expanded)
