title: CI – coverage gate + ccache sanity + build matrix guard
owner: codex
priority: P0
dependencies: []
goal: Enforce coverage ≥ spec minimum; confirm ccache active; matrix skips when no native code changes.
outputs:
  - .github/workflows/ci.yml (amend)
  - tests/ci/test_ccache_sanity.py
deliverables:
  - Coverage job fails under target; prints summary.
  - Native build steps gated by path filters / hashFiles.
acceptance:
  - CI green on main; fails when coverage dips below threshold
