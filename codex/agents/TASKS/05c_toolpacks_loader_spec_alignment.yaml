title: Toolpacks Loader â€” Spec Alignment
description: >
  Update loader to enforce spec field names (camelCase, not snake_case),
  validate execution.kind against approved set, and introduce
  ToolpackValidationError. Ensure $ref schema resolution and jsonschema
  check_schema are applied on load.
goals:
  - Align all field names with ragx_master_spec.yaml (camelCase).
  - Whitelist execution kinds: [python, node, php, cli, http].
  - Add ToolpackValidationError class.
  - Resolve $ref and validate schema structure at load time.
deliverables:
  - apps/toolpacks/loader.py updated
  - tests/unit/test_toolpacks_loader.py with new cases
  - docs/toolpacks_loader.md updated
