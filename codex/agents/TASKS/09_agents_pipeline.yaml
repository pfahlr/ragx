title: Implement Multi-Agent Research Pipeline
description: >
  Implement Planner → Executor → Publisher pipeline. Support parallel retrieval
  and summarization, deterministic outputs, and report/outline/bibliography assembly.
steps:
  - Implement Planner.plan(), Executor.run(), Publisher.assemble().
  - Add CLI (rw research) and MCP method.
  - Assemble artifacts (report.md, outline.md, bibliography.md).
tests:
  - file: tests/unit/test_agents_pipeline.py
    purpose: Verify pipeline stages are callable independently.
  - file: tests/e2e/test_agents_pipeline_end2end.py
    purpose: Run full pipeline on small fixture, check artifacts generated.
