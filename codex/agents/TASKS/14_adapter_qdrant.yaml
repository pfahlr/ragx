title: Qdrant Adapter
description: >
  HTTP adapter for Qdrant collections using HNSW; translate add/search and filters;
  approximate serialize via collection dump when available.
assumptions:
  - CI uses httpx mocks; live tests behind env flag.
steps:
  - Implement HTTP client mapping our IndexSpec to Qdrant create/index params.
  - Implement add/search with payload metadata mapping.
  - Implement dump/load placeholders and warnings on non-portable formats.
tests:
  - file: tests/unit/test_qdrant_mapping.py
    purpose: Spec and filter mapping correctness.
  - file: tests/e2e/test_qdrant_adapter_offline.py
    purpose: End-to-end mocked add/search parity with Search schema.
