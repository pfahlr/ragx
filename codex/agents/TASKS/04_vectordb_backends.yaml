title: Implement Vector DB Backends
description: >
  Implement FAISS (CPU+GPU), HNSWlib, and cuVS backends in C++ with pybind11,
  wired into the Vector DB Core registry. Must conform to Handle protocol and
  pass spec tests. Include shard merge semantics.
steps:
  - Generate C++ interface `ragcore::IIndex` with required methods.
  - Implement FAISS backend (flat, ivf_flat, ivfpq).
  - Implement HNSW backend (via hnswlib).
  - Implement GPU backend (cuVS) with CPU serialize/merge fallback.
  - Add pybind11 bindings exposing `Handle`.
  - Register all backends in Python registry.
tests:
  - file: tests/unit/test_spec_vectordb_backends.py
    purpose: Verify each backend registers and implements required methods.
  - file: tests/e2e/test_vectordb_build_and_search.py
    purpose: Build/search small indexes across all backends.
