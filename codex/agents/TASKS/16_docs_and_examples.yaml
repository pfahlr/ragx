title: Documentation & Examples Pack
description: >
  Generate developer and operator documentation from the master spec; include runnable examples
  for DSL flows, MCP calls, and VectorDB builds. Ensure docs validated in CI.
steps:
  - Create docs/ with index.md, quickstart.md, dsl.md, mcp.md, vectordb.md, agents.md.
  - Add examples/ with minimal runnable flows and scripts.
  - Add docs build step to CI (linkcheck + code fences tested).
tests:
  - file: tests/unit/test_docs_snippets_run.py
    purpose: Code blocks in docs compile/run on CI fixtures.
  - file: tests/unit/test_examples_integrity.py
    purpose: Examples directory has expected files and passes smoke tests.
