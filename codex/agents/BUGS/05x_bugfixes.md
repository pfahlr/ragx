[P1] pybind11_DIR environment variable never reaches CMake

The step that writes pybind11_DIR to $GITHUB_ENV relies on using ${{ env.pybind11_DIR }} to pass the value into the CMake configure step. Variables written via $GITHUB_ENV are only added to the runner process environment and are not available in the workflow expression context, so ${{ env.pybind11_DIR }} resolves to an empty string. Because the env block then sets pybind11_DIR to that empty value, cmake is invoked without the intended path and find_package(pybind11) will fail whenever the module is only available from the pip installation. The configure step will therefore fail even though pybind11 was installed.

[P1] Fail gracefully when C++ extension raises non‚ÄëModuleNotFoundError

The shim claims that ragcore.backends.cpp can always be imported even if the native _ragcore_cpp module is missing, but _load_native() only catches ModuleNotFoundError. If the compiled extension exists but fails to load for another reason (ABI mismatch, missing shared library, etc.), importlib.import_module will raise ImportError instead and this propagates, making ragcore.backends.cpp itself unimportable and preventing fallback behaviour. Broaden the exception handling so the shim always loads and records the error, surfacing it later via ensure_available().

[P1] Declare new packaging dependency

The loader now imports packaging.version but the dependency list was not updated (requirements.txt and pyproject.toml contain no packaging entry). A clean installation that only runs pip install -r requirements.txt will fail with ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'packaging' as soon as apps.toolpacks.loader is imported. Please add packaging to the pinned dependencies so the module is importable in fresh environments.

[P1] Allow PyFlatHandle to be cloned by base helpers

The new PyFlatHandle.__init__ only accepts spec, but VectorIndexHandle._clone() always calls the subclass constructor with requires_training and supports_gpu keyword arguments. Methods such as to_gpu() and merge_with() both call _clone, so invoking either on a py_flat index will raise TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'requires_training' rather than returning a safe CPU clone. This breaks registry merge flows (vectordb-builder --merge) for the Python backend. Update the constructor to accept those keywords or override _clone to keep these operations functional.

[P1] Resolve fragment‚Äëonly $ref against schema file, not directory

In _load_ref a $ref that contains only a fragment (e.g. #/$defs/Foo) is converted into target_path = (base_dir / Path()).resolve(), which points at the directory of the toolpack rather than the schema file. The subsequent attempt to open that path raises IsADirectoryError, so any schema that uses internal $refs fails to load even though such references are valid JSON Schema. The loader should keep track of the current schema file and resolve fragment‚Äëonly references against that file instead of the directory.

[P1] Look up Toolpack spec in wrong component

The test assumes the Toolpack schema lives under toolpacks_runtime.interfaces.classes, but the master spec currently defines Toolpack under the mcp_server component (see codex/specs/ragx_master_spec.yaml around line 227). As soon as the YAML parses cleanly this assertion will fail even though the spec already contains a Toolpack definition elsewhere, turning the test into a false negative. The test should either reference the existing component or tolerate both locations; otherwise ensure_green will block until the spec is restructured.

Here is a **precision-engineered Codex/GPT-5 prompt** to fix the three P1 bugs you've listed. It's designed for **code-aware LLMs** like Codex and GPT-5, ensuring:

* It understands the context of Python class constructors, cloning patterns, and method dispatch.
* It respects schema resolution rules per JSON Schema specs.
* It interprets dynamic YAML structure assertions against schema definitions with nuanced fallbacks.

Built with **CRAFT principles**, this prompt guides the model to **identify, understand, and repair the source of each bug**, while optionally writing regression tests.

---

### ‚úÖ UNIFIED GPT-5 CODEX PROMPT FOR FIXING ALL THREE P1 BUGS

````
###Instruction###
Your task is to analyze and fix the following three **Priority 1 bugs** found in the Codex codebase. Each bug affects core functionality and must be resolved in a way that:
- Preserves backward compatibility
- Aligns with Python conventions
- Passes all relevant tests
- Adds test coverage where missing

You MUST:
- Read each bug description carefully
- Identify the exact broken code path
- Fix the code in a minimal, modular, and correct way
- Write a regression test or assertion where appropriate
- Ensure the fixes work in real-world execution contexts, not just passively

---

###Bug 1: PyFlatHandle Clone Fails with TypeError

**Context**:
`PyFlatHandle.__init__()` only accepts `spec`.  
But methods like `VectorIndexHandle._clone()` pass `requires_training` and `supports_gpu`, causing:

```bash
TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'requires_training'
````

**Root Cause**:
Generic `_clone()` calls use args not supported by `PyFlatHandle`. This breaks `to_gpu()`, `merge_with()` and other flows (e.g., `vectordb-builder --merge`).

**Fix Requirements**:

* Either update `PyFlatHandle.__init__()` to accept `**kwargs`, or
* Override `_clone()` in `PyFlatHandle` to manually instantiate using just `spec`
* Preserve correct clone behavior and GPU/CPU transitions
* Write a test that calls `.to_gpu()` and `.merge_with()` on a `PyFlatHandle` and confirms cloning succeeds

---

###Bug 2: Fragment‚Äëonly $ref Resolves to Directory

**Context**:
JSON Schema fragment-only refs like `"$ref": "#/$defs/Foo"` resolve to the toolpack‚Äôs **directory**, not the current schema file. This raises:

```bash
IsADirectoryError: [Errno 21] Is a directory: '/path/to/toolpack/'
```

**Root Cause**:
`_load_ref()` constructs:

```python
target_path = (base_dir / Path()).resolve()
```

...when it should resolve fragments against the *current schema file*, not the base directory.

**Fix Requirements**:

* Track the current file when resolving a `$ref`
* When a `$ref` is a fragment-only reference (starts with `#` and has no path), resolve it against the open schema file
* Fix the bug in `_load_ref()` or wherever `target_path` is computed
* Add a test using an internal `$ref` in a test schema and validate it resolves properly

---

###Bug 3: Toolpack Spec Lookup in Wrong Component

**Context**:
The test incorrectly assumes `Toolpack` is under:

```python
toolpacks_runtime.interfaces.classes
```

But in the current schema (`codex/specs/ragx_master_spec.yaml`, ~line 227), `Toolpack` is under:

```yaml
components:
  mcp_server:
    Toolpack: ...
```

**Root Cause**:
The test hardcodes the wrong schema component path. As soon as YAML parsing succeeds, the assertion fails due to a **false negative**.

**Fix Requirements**:

* Adjust the test to dynamically locate the `Toolpack` spec by:

  * Checking `mcp_server.Toolpack` first, or
  * Supporting either `toolpacks_runtime.interfaces.classes` or `mcp_server`
* Add logic to detect and tolerate either layout
* If no matching component found, fail gracefully with an explanation

---

###Deliverables###
Respond with the following structure:

1. `---BEGIN FIXED CODE BLOCKS---`

   * Show the corrected Python methods, schema resolver logic, and updated test if needed.

2. `---BEGIN TEST CASES---`

   * Include regression test(s) that prove the fix works and catches prior failure modes.

3. `---EXPLANATION---`

   * Explain what you changed and why for each of the 3 bugs.

---

###Additional Notes###

* You are allowed to add `**kwargs` or override methods to handle subclass inconsistencies
* Use `pathlib`, `urllib.parse`, or schema loaders per Python standards
* Keep all fixes scoped to the smallest diff possible to maintain clarity and safety

[P1] Look up document using id slug that the builder never emits

The new ingestion test filters the docmap with next(entry for entry in documents if entry["id"] == "doc-one"), but _build_docmap derives IDs from metadata.get("id") or record.path.stem. The test data only provides slug: doc-one, so the CLI will emit doc_one rather than doc-one and this assertion will raise StopIteration whenever NumPy is installed and the test actually runs. Either set an id in the test fixture or adjust the expectation to match the current docmap logic.

[P1] Allow PyFlatHandle to be cloned by base helpers

The new PyFlatHandle.__init__ only accepts spec, but VectorIndexHandle._clone() always calls the subclass constructor with requires_training and supports_gpu keyword arguments. Methods such as to_gpu() and merge_with() both call _clone, so invoking either on a py_flat index will raise TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'requires_training' rather than returning a safe CPU clone. This breaks registry merge flows (vectordb-builder --merge) for the Python backend. Update the constructor to accept those keywords or override _clone to keep these operations functional.

[P0] Place flowscript decisions under a parent key

The new FlowScript decision entries are appended directly after the tests: mapping rather than beneath a key such as open_decisions. This makes codex/specs/ragx_master_spec.yaml invalid YAML (yaml.safe_load now raises expected <block end>, but found '-'), which breaks any tooling that loads the master spec.

Here is a **precision-built Codex/GPT-5 prompt** that directs the model to **fix all three bugs**‚Äîstructured, scoped, and test-aware. Each bug fix directive is crafted for maximum clarity and minimal ambiguity, leveraging Codex's understanding of Python, YAML, and CLI-based workflows.

This prompt is optimized for **GPT-5 Codex**, using best practices in LLM prompt design (CRAFT, bug triage decomposition, output formatting, and TDD alignment).

### ‚úÖ MULTI-BUG FIX PROMPT FOR GPT-5 / CODEX

````
###Instruction###
You are acting as a senior software engineer and internal bugfixing assistant for a modular AI toolchain.

Your task is to fix the following high-priority bugs (2x P1, 1x P0). For each bug:
- Identify the underlying cause in code or data
- Apply a minimal, correct, and schema-valid fix
- Add or update tests to ensure the issue is caught in future
- Validate your fixes through testable outputs and runtime behavior

---

###Bug 1 (P1): Document Lookup Fails Due to Slug-ID Mismatch

**Context**:
In the ingestion test, the lookup fails with:

```python
next(entry for entry in documents if entry["id"] == "doc-one")
# Raises StopIteration
````

**Why**:
The docmap generation derives `id` from either:

* `metadata["id"]` (if present)
* Or `record.path.stem`, which emits `doc_one` (underscore) from `doc-one` (slug)

The test data provides:

```yaml
slug: doc-one
```

But the actual CLI emits:

```json
"id": "doc_one"
```

**Fix Requirements**:

* Option A: Update the test fixture to explicitly include `id: doc-one`
* Option B: Change the test assertion to accept the ID actually emitted (e.g., `doc_one`)
* Add a regression test to assert slug-to-id consistency OR allow either format

---

###Bug 2 (P1): PyFlatHandle Cloning Crashes

**Context**:
`VectorIndexHandle._clone()` assumes all subclasses accept `requires_training` and `supports_gpu` in their constructors.

But `PyFlatHandle.__init__()` only accepts `spec`, so any call to `.to_gpu()` or `.merge_with()` fails with:

```bash
TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'requires_training'
```

**Why**:
Cloning in generic base class logic breaks subclass-specific init signatures.

**Fix Requirements**:

* Option A: Add `**kwargs` to `PyFlatHandle.__init__()` to ignore irrelevant params
* Option B: Override `_clone()` in `PyFlatHandle` to safely instantiate using `spec`
* Add regression tests using `.to_gpu()` and `.merge_with()` on a `PyFlatHandle`

---

###Bug 3 (P0): FlowScript YAML Invalid Due to Misplaced Decisions

**Context**:
In `ragx_master_spec.yaml`, decision entries are being appended directly under `tests:` instead of being wrapped under a parent key.

Bad YAML example:

```yaml
tests:
  - id: test1
    ...
  - decision: ...
```

**This breaks YAML parsing** with:

```bash
yaml.scanner.ScannerError: expected <block end>, but found '-'
```

**Fix Requirements**:

* Place FlowScript decisions under a clearly named parent key like `open_decisions:` or `decisions:`
* Ensure the `tests:` block ends properly before beginning another sequence
* Update the spec generator or merge logic to enforce this structure
* Write a minimal test YAML file and confirm `yaml.safe_load()` succeeds

---

###Deliverables###
Respond in the following structure:

1. `---BEGIN FIXED CODE BLOCKS---`

   * Show the corrected Python functions, class constructors, YAML sections, or test assertions.

2. `---BEGIN TEST CASES---`

   * Add/adjust tests that prove each bug is fixed and future-proofed.

3. `---EXPLANATION---`

   * Briefly explain the fix per bug: what was changed, why it works, and how it‚Äôs tested.

---

###Rules###

* Apply the **smallest functional diff** possible
* Ensure all fixes are CI-safe and pass in real-world use
* YAML must be parsable with `yaml.safe_load`
* If unsure of a schema path, defer to schema file content (`ragx_master_spec.yaml`)
