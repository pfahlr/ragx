# Phase 6 Summary â€“ 07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration

## Highlights
- Restored nested loop execution in `FlowRunner`, preventing body traversal from crashing when loops appear inside loop bodies (runner-up requirement from extended task notes).
- Hardened `TraceEventEmitter` so sinks and validators observe deeply immutable payloads, closing the remaining observability gap noted in Phase 4 test plans.
- Added targeted regression tests under `codex/code/07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration.yaml/tests/` to lock in nested-loop semantics and payload freezing guarantees.

## Code Review Follow-ups
- Addressed the Phase 5 review by allowing `_run_loop` to recurse for nested `kind="loop"` entries and by simplifying `_apply_budget` now that commits occur explicitly. No outstanding review items remain.

## Documentation
- Updated `/README.md`, `/docs/README.md`, and `/docs/07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration.yaml.md` to describe nested-loop support, deep-freeze behaviour, and the new regression suite.

## Tests
- New regression coverage: `test_flow_runner_auto_phase6.py` (nested loops) and `test_trace_auto_phase6.py` (payload immutability).
- Existing unit suites in `tests/unit/dsl/` remain green alongside the dedicated codex regression suite.
