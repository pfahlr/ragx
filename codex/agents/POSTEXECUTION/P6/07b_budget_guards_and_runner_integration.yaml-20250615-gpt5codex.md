# Phase 6 Post-Execution â€” 07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration

## Summary
- Added nested-loop recursion and defensive node validation to `pkgs/dsl/flow_runner.py`, closing the remaining review item on loop payload handling and cleaning up the unused `_apply_budget(..., commit=True)` branch.
- Introduced a dedicated Phase 6 regression suite at `codex/code/07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration.yaml/tests/test_flow_runner_auto_phase6.py` to cover nested loops and clearer error surfacing.
- Refreshed README, docs/README, and docs/07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration.yaml.md to document the new behaviour, point to the updated test harness, and align terminology with the final Phase 6 deliverable.

## Runner-up Components
- No `codex/agents/TASKS_FINAL/P4/extended-07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration.yaml-*` assets were present in the repository; no additional runner-up modules required integration.

## Code Review Alignment
- Addressed the Phase 5 review findings by (1) recursing through nested loop payloads before invoking `_run_unit_node` and (2) removing the unused `_apply_budget` commit toggle.

## Tests
- Added `codex/code/07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration.yaml/tests/test_flow_runner_auto_phase6.py` and executed the scoped suite: `pytest codex/code/07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration.yaml/tests -q`.
- Re-ran legacy coverage to ensure compatibility: `pytest tests/unit/dsl/test_flow_runner_auto.py -q`.

## CLI / Docs Validation
- Verified CLI help parity for `ragcore.cli` and `apps.mcp_server.cli` after installing missing dependencies (numpy, uvicorn, fastapi). Updated docs mirror the observed flags and defaults.
