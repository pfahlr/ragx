# Phase 6 Postexecution Summary â€“ 07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration

## Runner-up components
- Added recursive handling for nested loop entries in `FlowRunner._run_loop`, allowing loop bodies to mix loop and unit nodes without KeyError failures while preserving budget stop semantics.
- Simplified the budget preview helper by removing the unused `commit` flag so scope commits always flow through `BudgetManager.commit_charge`, keeping trace emission order explicit.

## Code review items
- Addressed the Phase 5 medium finding by routing nested `kind="loop"` entries through `_run_loop` recursion.
- Retired the unused `_apply_budget(commit=True)` branch noted in the low-severity review comment by eliminating the parameter entirely.

## Tests
- Created `test_flow_runner_auto_phase6.py` under the task-specific suite to cover nested loop execution and post-node run-scope commits. Updated `pytest.ini` so the new suite is exercised by default targets.

## Documentation & CLI
- Synced root and docs READMEs plus the task design document to reference the dedicated regression suite and the new nested loop coverage. Verified `phase3_runner.py --help` remains accurate.
