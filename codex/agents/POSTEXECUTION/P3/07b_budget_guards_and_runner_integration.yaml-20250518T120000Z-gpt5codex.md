# Phase 3 Post-Execution â€” Task 07b Budget Guards & Runner Integration

## Summary
- Implemented budget domain models, manager orchestration, trace emitter, policy stack, and FlowRunner integration per plan.
- Added targeted pytest suites covering budget decisions, runner stop semantics, warnings, and trace ordering.

## Test & Coverage Results
- `pytest codex/code/task_07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration/tests -q` (pass).
- Coverage tooling not executed in this phase; rely on targeted unit tests.

## Notes
- All warnings originate from soft budgets and are surfaced via both preview and commit events.
- Consider extending result dataclasses with trace references if downstream consumers need direct access.
