# Phase 3 Post-Execution — Budget Guards & FlowRunner Integration

## Test Results
- `pytest codex/code/work/tests -q` (pass) — validates budget manager limits and FlowRunner loop stop integration. 【b2ec7f†L1-L1】

## Coverage & Gaps
- Unit coverage exercises both hard/soft modes and preview path; integration test inspects trace payloads and stop reasons.
- Remaining gap: no regression around policy-stack interactions or mixed policy/budget violations (captured in missing tests list).

## Follow-ups
- Package `codex` namespace for automatic discovery to remove explicit `sys.path` adjustments in tests.
