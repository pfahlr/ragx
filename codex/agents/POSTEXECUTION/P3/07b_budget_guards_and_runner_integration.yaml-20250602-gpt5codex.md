# Phase 3 Post-Execution â€” Budget Guards & Runner Integration

## Summary
- All planned unit and integration tests passed after implementing budget models, manager orchestration, trace writer, and FlowRunner slice.
- Trace emissions validated for schema compliance and chronological ordering with sequence counters.

## Test & Coverage Notes
- Command executed: `pytest codex/code/07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration.yaml/tests -q`.
- Coverage instrumentation not collected in this sandbox; qualitative review confirms exercises across run/node scopes and warn/stop actions.

## Observations
- BudgetManager emits breach metadata via `dataclasses.asdict`, avoiding slot-related access errors discovered during TDD cycle.
- Helper fixtures now insert modules into `sys.modules` prior to execution to satisfy dataclass processing.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Integrate schema-level assertions with jsonschema fixtures once shared contract file becomes available.
- Extend FlowRunner slice with policy enforcement mocks to test interleaving of policy and budget traces.
