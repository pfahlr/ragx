# Phase 3 Post-Execution â€” 07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration

## Test & Coverage Notes
- Pytest suite for sandbox runner passes: `PYTHONPATH=codex/code/phase3-07b-budget-guards-b3c8 pytest codex/code/phase3-07b-budget-guards-b3c8/tests -q`. (see run log chunk 268758)
- Budget manager, trace emitter, and runner modules exercised across normal/warn/stop pathways.

## Implementation Observations
- Sequential scope charging halts once a stop decision is observed to avoid duplicate breach events.
- Loop summaries annotate `soft_budget_warn` vs `budget_stop` to preserve auditability.
- Cost normalization clamps tiny floats to zero to maintain deterministic assertions.
