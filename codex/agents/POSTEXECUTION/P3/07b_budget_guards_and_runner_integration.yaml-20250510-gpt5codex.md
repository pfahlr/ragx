# Post-Execution Report — 07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration

## Test Results
- `pytest codex/code/phase3_budget_runner_r7h3/tests -q`
  - Status: ✅
  - Notes: 8 tests executed covering cost normalization, manager semantics, and FlowRunner loop/stop behaviours.

## Coverage & Quality Notes
- BudgetManager paths for warn/stop/error exercised with immutable snapshot assertions.
- FlowRunner integration verifies trace emission order and stop reasons but does not yet validate policy trace payloads.

## Follow-ups
- Add fixtures validating trace payload schema against the DSL contract.
- Extend normalization helpers for CPU/memory metrics when spec enumerates them.
