# Phase 3 Post-Execution â€“ Budget guards integrated with FlowRunner

## Test Execution
- `pytest codex/code/work/tests/work -q`
- `pytest codex/code/work/tests -q`

## Outcomes
- Loop stop scenario halts only the loop scope; run continues and emits `loop_summary` with breach payload.
- Policy trace bridge emits `policy_push`, `policy_resolved`, `policy_pop`, and `policy_violation` events via the shared emitter.
- Budget manager now exposes `decision` metadata on raised breaches, enabling richer diagnostics and assertions.

## Follow-up Recommendations
- Add property-based tests around loop iteration accounting (budget stop vs. warn) once more loop stop triggers are implemented.
- Consider integration coverage that exercises simultaneous policy violation and loop budget stop to validate ordering semantics.
