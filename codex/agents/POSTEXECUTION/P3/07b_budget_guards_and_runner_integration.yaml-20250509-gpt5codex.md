# Phase 3 Post-execution â€” Budget Guards & Runner Integration

## Execution Notes
- Completed unit test suite via `pytest codex/code/07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration.yaml/tests -q`.
- Preflight handling now emits `budget_breach` traces before raising on hard budgets to preserve observability parity with commit pathways.
- Loop summaries capture iteration counts and stop reasons (`budget_stop`, `max_iterations`) and are returned as mapping proxies.

## Coverage / Quality
- Unit tests span budget models, manager orchestration, and FlowRunner behaviour, exercising both happy paths and breach scenarios.
- Trace immutability verified through attempted mutation checks in tests.

## Follow-ups / TODOs
- Consider integrating PolicyStack trace emission once cross-task interfaces stabilize.
- Evaluate whether to surface aggregate run summaries (spend per metric) for downstream analytics in a future phase.
