# Post-execution Report — Phase 3 Budget Guards Integration

## Test Results
- `PYTHONPATH=codex/code/phase3-budget-runner-4f72 pytest codex/code/phase3-budget-runner-4f72/tests -q`
  - Status: ✅ (8 tests) — see run log chunk `f38e33`.

## Coverage / Confidence
- Unit-level verification covers cost normalisation and budget manager
  semantics, exercising both soft and hard enforcement branches.
- Integration tests drive FlowRunner through soft continuation, hard stop, and
  policy violation paths ensuring trace sequencing works end-to-end.

## Implementation Notes
- `BudgetManager` scopes accounts by `f"{run_id}:{spec.scope_id}"` to avoid
  cross-run leakage while preserving spec-level budgeting semantics.
- PolicyStack split into `check`/`resolved` phases so `policy_resolved` only
  fires after successful execution, preventing trace inflation on hard stops.
- Loop summaries currently emit projected spend; additional aggregate fields can
  be added once downstream schema requirements are clarified.
