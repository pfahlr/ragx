# Phase 3 Post-Execution â€” Budget Guards and Runner Integration

## Test Run
- `pytest codex/code/work/tests -q`

All tests passed. BudgetManager and FlowRunner integration verified for hard stop, soft warning, and trace emission paths.

## Coverage + Observations
- BudgetManager preview/commit exercised through unit tests, including immutability assertions.
- FlowRunner exercised through loop budget halt scenario; future suites should add policy violation coverage and spec-level budgets.
- Trace emitter validated for policy and budget events; consider schema-level validation in later phases.
