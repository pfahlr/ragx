# Phase 3 Post-Execution – Budget guards and runner integration

## Test Results
- ✅ `pytest codex/code/phase3_budget_runner/tests -q`

## Coverage & Quality Notes
- Budget models, manager, and runner modules exercised via unit + integration tests.
- Soft vs hard breach behaviour validated along with immutable trace payload guarantees.
- Policy violation scenario confirms FlowRunner cleans up scopes and emits traces before raising.

## Follow-ups
- Consider adding schema validation harness against `dsl_trace_event.schema.json` to guard payload regressions.
- Future work: extend integration suite with loop-scope budgets once loop semantics land.
