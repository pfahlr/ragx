# Phase 3 Post-Execution â€“ Budget guards and runner integration

## Test Results
- `pytest codex/code/work/tests -q`
  - Loop, policy, and trace validation suites all pass (16 tests).

## Coverage & Behaviour Notes
- Loop budget stops emit `loop_stop` traces and preserve run history with no extra spend committed.
- Policy denials exit node scopes while run scopes remain inspectable with zero spend snapshots.
- Trace validators block invalid payloads before they are stored or forwarded to sinks.

## Follow-ups
- Extend loop coverage to nested loops and decision nodes once those constructs are implemented.
- Consider optional policy push/pop around loop bodies when DSL policies differ per iteration.
