# Phase 3 Post-Execution â€” 07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration

## Execution Notes
- All planned unit tests executed successfully via `pytest codex/code/07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration.yaml/tests -q`.
- Trace inspection confirmed spec-level preflight breaches produce dedicated `budget_breach` events alongside node-level warnings.
- Warning aggregation verified that run-level warnings emit once even when multiple nodes exceed the soft budget.

## Coverage & Validation
- Targeted tests cover value objects, manager semantics, and FlowRunner integration. No additional coverage tooling was run; pytest assertions ensure behaviour parity with the review checklist.

## Follow-up Recommendations
- Consider upstreaming the trace schema dictionary to a shared observability module to avoid duplication across future phases.
- Extend FlowRunner scenarios with nested loops or spec combinations once broader DSL contracts are available.
