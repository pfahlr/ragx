# Phase 3 Post-Execution â€” Task 07b

## Execution Summary
- Pytest suite for sandbox branch executed successfully (see runlog and coverage output).
- BudgetManager validated for soft/hard scenarios; FlowRunner integration verified for warn vs stop and policy ordering.
- TraceEventEmitter confirmed to emit immutable payloads for budget and policy events.

## Coverage & Metrics
- Coverage collected via `phase3_runner.py` (pytest --cov) targeting `codex/code/phase3-budget-guards-d98ee6c7/pkgs`.
- Manual run in container: `pytest codex/code/phase3-budget-guards-d98ee6c7/tests -q`.

## Notes & Risks
- Current implementation exercises run-level budgets; loop/node scope handling should be expanded in future phases.
- Trace payloads are schema-aligned by contract but formal jsonschema validation remains a follow-up.
