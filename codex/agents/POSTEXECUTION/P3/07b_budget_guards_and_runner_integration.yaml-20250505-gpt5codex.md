# Phase 3 Post-Execution â€“ Budget guards and runner integration

## Test & Coverage Summary
- `pytest codex/code/work/tests -q`
  - All 12 assertions passed across model, manager, and runner suites.

## Notable Outcomes
- History ledger in `BudgetManager` enables inspection after scope exit, satisfying integration tests.
- FlowRunner raises `BudgetBreachError` for node hard stops while leaving run scope history available for diagnostics.
- Trace emission centralised through `TraceEventEmitter` confirmed immutable payloads during tests.

## Follow-ups
- Consider schema validation of emitted payloads against DSL trace schema for additional safety.
- Extend integration tests to cover loop scopes and simultaneous policy + budget breaches.
