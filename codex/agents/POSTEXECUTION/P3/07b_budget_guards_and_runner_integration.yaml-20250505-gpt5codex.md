# Phase 3 Post-execution â€” Budget guards integrated in FlowRunner

## Test Results
- `pytest codex/code/work/tests -q`

## Coverage & Notes
- Tests exercise all budget models, manager paths, and FlowRunner stop scenarios with deterministic fakes.
- Loop stop path verified via emitted `loop_halt` event and iteration output aggregation.
- No additional linters executed in this phase; focus remained on targeted unit coverage.
- Trace emitter sharing confirmed through identity tests to prevent sink duplication.
