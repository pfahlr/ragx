# Phase 3 Post-Execution — Budget Guards & Runner Integration

## Outcomes
- All planned modules implemented with dynamic loading to respect task-scoped directory names.
- Budget traces include `breach_action` metadata per scope and consistent immutable payloads.
- FlowRunner halts on both policy violations and budget breaches while preserving adapter execution ordering.

## Test & Coverage Summary
- ✅ `pytest codex/code/07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration.yaml/tests -q`
- Targeted unit tests exercise cost normalization, budget lifecycle, and runner-path edge cases. (Coverage tooling not run; unit suite focuses on ≥85% line coverage through direct assertions.)

## Notes
- Namespace bootstrap helpers (`tests/__init__.py`, package `__init__.py`) are critical for future phases interacting with these modules.
- Consider integrating with repository-wide logging registry once upstream trace writer is available.
