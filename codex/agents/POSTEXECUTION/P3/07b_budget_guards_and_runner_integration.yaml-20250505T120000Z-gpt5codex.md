# Post-execution Summary — Phase 3

## Test Results
- ✅ `pytest codex/code/work/tests/unit -q`

## Coverage Notes
- Budget domain models and manager operations are exercised via deterministic unit tests; loop stop, hard breach, and soft warning pathways are covered.
- FlowRunner tests execute loop and node scenarios ensuring policy enforcement and budget propagation.

## Remaining Gaps
- No integration with caching/adapters beyond synchronous stubs; real adapter cost variance untested.
- Trace schema validation remains TODO; current emitter ensures immutability only.
