  branch_diffs:
    - from: codex/integrate-budget-guards-with-runner
      to: codex/integrate-budget-guards-with-runner-zwi2ny
      git_diff: |
        (no diff; DSL policy engine files are byte-identical)
      commentary: |
        zwi2ny is a direct copy of integrate-budget-guards-with-runner. The PolicyStack,
        datamodels, and absence of tests are unchanged, so there is no divergent behavior to reconcile.
    - from: codex/integrate-budget-guards-with-runner
      to: codex/integrate-budget-guards-with-runner-pbdel9
      git_diff: |
        (no diff; DSL policy engine files are byte-identical)
      commentary: |
        pbdel9 mirrors the same implementation. There are no additional safeguards or tests beyond
        what the base branch already provides.
    - from: codex/integrate-budget-guards-with-runner
      to: codex/implement-budget-guards-with-test-first-approach
      git_diff: |
        (no diff; DSL policy engine files are byte-identical)
      commentary: |
        Despite the branch name, this variant ships the same PolicyStack module and likewise omits
        any budget-policy integration tests.
    - from: codex/integrate-budget-guards-with-runner
      to: codex/implement-budget-guards-with-test-first-approach-qhq0jq
      git_diff: |
        (no diff; DSL policy engine files are byte-identical)
      commentary: |
        qhq0jq contributes no functional divergence. Policy resolution and tracing semantics remain
        identical to the base branch.
    - from: codex/integrate-budget-guards-with-runner
      to: codex/implement-budget-guards-with-test-first-approach-8wxk32
      git_diff: |
        (no diff; DSL policy engine files are byte-identical)
      commentary: |
        8wxk32 is another carbon copy; there are no incremental fixes or regressions to highlight.
    - from: codex/integrate-budget-guards-with-runner
      to: codex/implement-budget-guards-with-test-first-approach-fa0vm9
      git_diff: |
        (no diff; DSL policy engine files are byte-identical)
      commentary: |
        fa0vm9 matches the base implementation verbatim. No additional coverage, validation, or API
        work is present.
  summary_of_findings:
    common_flaws:
      - Missing test coverage for PolicyStack enforcement, trace emission, and tool-set validation.
      - FlowRunner never consults PolicyStack, so runner integration is functionally absent.
      - PolicyTraceRecorder is only used by tests (which are missing), leaving tracing unverified.
    unique_strengths:
      - The shared PolicyStack emits push/pop/resolution/violation events and validates tool-set cycles.
      - PolicyDecision records allow/deny provenance, which is useful for future diagnostics.
    critical_gaps:
      - No branch enforces policy budgets within FlowRunner; tools can run without policy checks.
      - Tool registry normalization lacks schema validation beyond tag iterability.
      - No branch exercises enforce() raising PolicyViolationError, so regressions would go unnoticed.
confidence_notes:
  - area: enforce() semantics
    confidence: medium
    reason: Implementation appears sound, but the lack of tests and runner wiring leaves behavior unproven.
  - area: runner-policy integration
    confidence: low
    reason: Runner never calls PolicyStack, so intent is unclear and requires design confirmation.
coverage_gaps:
  - missing: unit test for policy_resolved trace payload shape and content.
  - missing: validation test for tool_set cycle detection and unknown tool references.
  - missing: integration test covering FlowRunner invoking PolicyStack.enforce().
traceability_checklist:
  - must-emit: push
  - must-emit: pop
  - must-emit: policy_resolved
  - must-emit: violation
  - must-raise: PolicyViolationError
