      commentary: |
        Branch `zwi2ny` layers a reusable `TraceWriter` abstraction and richer loop bookkeeping onto the base runner but keeps the policy stack identical.  It introduces `BudgetSpec`/`BudgetRemaining` types, yet their constructors are incomplete (no validation for unknown metrics), and loop control still assumes every control node is a loop, so policy hooks remain unused.

      commentary: |
        Branch `pbdel9` pushes further by normalising run/node outputs into immutable `mapping_proxy` views, adds explicit `TraceEvent` typing, and bifurcates hard-stop vs stop-on-breach behaviour.  However, budget events never emit `policy_resolved`/`violation` hooks and loop stopping only considers hard breaches—soft limits only log warnings without surfacing via stop reasons.

      commentary: |
        The `implement-budget-guards-with-test-first-approach` branch replaces the executable runner with a thin façade around an unimplemented `BudgetManager`.  While it sketches desirable entrypoints (`prepare_budgets`, recorder plumbing), it drops working enforcement, loop execution, and trace semantics—making it unsuitable without substantial fill-in.

      commentary: |
        Branch `qhq0jq` prototypes a richer execution contract—distinguishing loop summaries, adding preflight budget previews, and surfacing soft-limit warnings.  Its `BudgetMeter` supports mode-aware preview/charge and structured `BudgetCheck` results, but the runner never wires outputs or traces back into the PolicyStack, and it assumes a `BudgetMeter.from_spec` constructor not present elsewhere.

      commentary: |
        Branch `8wxk32` introduces adapter-driven node execution, explicit cost modelling, and trace emission on run start/end.  It keeps hierarchical loop walking and budgets but lacks hard/soft differentiation (breach action never honoured) and the run result regenerates a new UUID instead of returning the run's actual id.

      commentary: |
        Branch `fa0vm9` is the most feature-complete runner: it defines adapter protocols with estimate/execute phases, tracks nested loop contexts, and emits trace records on every charge/breach.  Its `BudgetMeter` supports preflight checks and breach metadata, but enforcement stops at per-node granularity—policy stack integration and unknown tool validation remain TODO, and returning a fresh run id on exit breaks trace correlation.
  summary_of_findings:
    common_flaws:
      - None of the branches integrate the PolicyStack into the runner execution path, so tool allow/deny decisions never gate adapter execution.
      - Soft budget breaches rarely influence control flow; only hard-mode loops stop, leaving soft warnings invisible to callers.
      - Several runners regenerate a new run_id in the RunResult instead of reporting the id used during execution.
    unique_strengths:
      - Branch `zwi2ny` contributes the cleanest trace writer abstraction and consistent loop iteration telemetry.
      - Branch `pbdel9` normalises outputs and trace payloads via `mapping_proxy`, ensuring immutability downstream.
      - Branch `qhq0jq` implements budget preview semantics (`BudgetCheck`) that support both hard and soft guardrails before execution.
      - Branch `fa0vm9` couples adapter protocols with hierarchical meter contexts, enabling reuse across unit and loop scopes.
    critical_gaps:
      - The stubbed `BudgetManager` branch removes executable logic entirely; adopting its interfaces would require substantial reimplementation.
      - None of the variants validate unknown tools against the registry before enqueuing execution, leaving a gap in policy/budget alignment.
      - Loop stop reasons and trace schema diverge across branches—no implementation emits the full `push`, `policy_resolved`, `policy_violation`, `pop` contract defined in the spec.
confidence_notes:
  - area: enforce() semantics
    confidence: medium
    reason: PolicyStack implementations are consistent, but no branch exercises the API end-to-end with the runner, so interaction bugs remain possible.
coverage_gaps:
  - missing: Unit tests for `policy_resolved` trace emission and PolicyViolationError pathways.
  - missing: Regression coverage for loop budget breach actions across hard/soft modes.
traceability_checklist:
  - must-emit: push
  - must-emit: pop
  - must-emit: policy_resolved
  - must-raise: PolicyViolationError
