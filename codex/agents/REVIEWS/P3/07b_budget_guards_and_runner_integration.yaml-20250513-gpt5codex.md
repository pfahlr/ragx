# Phase 3 Review â€” Task 07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration

## Verification Checklist
- [x] CostSnapshot enforces float normalization and immutable `MappingProxyType` payloads.
- [x] BudgetManager charges cascade to ancestor scopes with immutable remaining/overage snapshots.
- [x] TraceEventEmitter emits `budget_charge`, `budget_breach`, and `loop_summary` events with mapping-proxy payloads.
- [x] FlowRunner halts loops on hard breaches, emits summaries, and preserves policy enforcement semantics.
- [x] PolicyStack integrations continue to raise on violations; traces include `policy_resolved` events via recorder assertions.

## Test Evidence
- `pytest codex/code/07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration.yaml/tests/test_budget_manager.py -q`
- `pytest codex/code/07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration.yaml/tests/test_trace_emitter.py -q`
- `pytest codex/code/07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration.yaml/tests/test_flow_runner_budget_integration.py -q`
- `pytest codex/code/07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration.yaml/tests -q`

## Known Issues / Risks
- Dynamic module loading is used because the task directory name is not import-safe; future refactors may consolidate these into a formal package.
- Current FlowRunner implementation is synchronous and assumes deterministic adapters; async support remains out of scope.
