# Phase 3 Review Notes — Task 07b

## Checklist
- [x] BudgetManager preflight/commit logic covers soft and hard actions with accurate remaining/overage calculations.
- [x] TraceEventEmitter outputs immutable payloads for budget and policy events via MappingProxyType.
- [x] FlowRunner coordinates adapters, budgets, and policy stack while respecting stop semantics and trace ordering.
- [x] Tests added for manager, trace emitter, and runner integration run green under pytest.
- [x] Optional runner script executes pytest with coverage logging into POSTEXECUTION artifacts.

## Review Findings
- Budget scopes are registered with explicit specs and guard against duplicate registration.
- Hard-stop decisions emit breaches and terminate execution without executing subsequent nodes.
- Soft budgets issue warnings recorded in RunResult without producing breaches.
- Policy events propagate push → resolved → pop ordering even when execution terminates early.

## Follow-ups
- Consider extending scope handling to cover nested loop/node budgets beyond the run-level focus exercised here.
- Future tasks should validate trace payloads against the canonical JSON schema to catch field drift automatically.
