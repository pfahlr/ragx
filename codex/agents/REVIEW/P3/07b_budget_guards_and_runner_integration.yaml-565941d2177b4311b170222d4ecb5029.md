# Review Notes — Phase 3 Budget Guards Integration

## Summary
- ✅ BudgetManager preflight/commit mirrors zwi2ny+pbdel9 immutable payloads while
  enforcing qhq0jq soft/hard semantics; traces emitted through shared emitter.
- ✅ FlowRunner keeps fa0vm9 adapter orchestration and stops cleanly on hard
  breaches without executing downstream adapters.
- ✅ PolicyStack produces `policy_resolved` events only after successful adapter
  execution, matching POSTEXECUTION directives.

## Checklist
- [x] Cost normaliser returns MappingProxyType and converts seconds to ms once.
- [x] BudgetManager soft breach leaves scope mutable and emits `budget_breach`
      with severity `soft`.
- [x] Hard breach raises `BudgetHardStop` and preserves prior spend state.
- [x] FlowRunner does not execute adapters when preflight indicates hard stop.
- [x] Policy violations emit `policy_violation` and skip budget checks.
- [x] Tests cover soft warn continuation, hard stop halt, and policy violation.

## Potential Follow-ups
- Consider extending BudgetManager to reconcile estimate vs actual execution
  costs for more realistic accounting.
- Loop summary events currently carry projected spend only; downstream analytics
  might need cumulative spent as well.
