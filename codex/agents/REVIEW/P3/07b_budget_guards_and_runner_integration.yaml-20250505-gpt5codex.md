# Phase 3 Review Notes â€” Budget guards integrated in FlowRunner

## Checklist
- [x] Data models remain immutable via frozen dataclasses and mapping proxies.
- [x] BudgetManager emits consistent `budget_preflight`/`budget_charge`/`budget_breach` payloads with context.
- [x] FlowRunner halts on stop outcomes and records `stop_reason` in `RunResult`.
- [x] Policy trace emission uses the shared `TraceEventEmitter` and carries allowlists.
- [x] Tests cover hard/soft budgets, loop stop conditions, and trace payloads.

## Review Notes
- Ensured `TraceEventEmitter` truthiness no longer depends on `__len__` by guarding against falsy injection.
- Loop preflight now warns but proceeds so commit stops emit deterministic `loop_halt` events.
- Added `run_halt` emission for run-level stops to make diagnostics symmetrical across scopes.
- Verified tests assert both event payloads and stop semantics to guard against regressions.
