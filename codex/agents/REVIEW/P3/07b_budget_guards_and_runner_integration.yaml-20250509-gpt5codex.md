# Phase 3 Review â€” Budget Guards & Runner Integration

## Implementation Summary
- Immutable budget data structures and normalization utilities implemented in `budget_models.py`.
- Hierarchical `BudgetManager` with trace emission and strict preflight/commit semantics delivered in `budget_manager.py`.
- `FlowRunner` now enforces budgets, halts loops on stop requests, raises on hard breaches, and emits `loop_stop` / `budget_breach` events while coordinating adapters via the shared emitter.

## Review Checklist
- [x] Budget normalization converts seconds to milliseconds deterministically and clamps negative limits.
- [x] BudgetManager prevents spend leakage across parent/child scopes and returns immutable `BudgetDecision` payloads.
- [x] FlowRunner halts loops when `breach_action == "stop"` and raises on hard run-level breaches.
- [x] Trace payloads (charges, breaches, loop stops) are frozen via mapping proxies to enforce immutability in tests.
- [x] Unit tests assert trace content, stop reasons, and exception semantics for regression coverage.

## Verification
- Unit suite (`pytest codex/code/07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration.yaml/tests -q`) passes locally.

## Known Issues / Follow-ups
- None identified in Phase 3. Future work may integrate PolicyStack traces once task 07a contracts are finalized.
