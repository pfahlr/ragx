# Phase 3 Review â€” Budget Guards & Runner Integration

## Checklist Alignment
- [x] Immutable dataclasses avoid mutable defaults and expose mapping proxies.
- [x] BudgetManager soft breach returns warnings without raising and toggles `should_stop` only for hard breaches.
- [x] FlowRunner halts deterministically on hard breaches and records chronological trace events.
- [x] Trace schema matches `{timestamp, scope, event, data, sequence}` contract with normalized costs.
- [x] Tests span run/node scopes and both preflight & commit flows.

## Verification Notes
- Unit and integration suites executed via `pytest codex/code/07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration.yaml/tests -q`.
- Trace payload assertions ensure scope and breach metadata survive conversions.
- Dummy adapter doubles confirm adapter-driven execution order is preserved.

## Known Issues / Follow-ups
- FlowRunner slice currently scoped to sandbox; upstream wiring will need alignment with production adapters and policy stack.
- BudgetManager currently assumes single-threaded access; concurrency-safe guards not yet implemented.
