# Phase 3 Review — 07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration

## Checklist
- [x] Cost normalization handles seconds vs milliseconds inputs.
- [x] Soft breaches emit warnings without stopping loops; traces capture `budget_breach` once per scope.
- [x] Hard breaches stop loop execution and annotate `RunResult.stop_reason`.
- [x] Policy trace order verified as push → resolved → budget_charge → pop.
- [x] Dataclasses frozen to prevent payload mutation.

## Notes
- Node budgets remain soft in the sandbox to isolate loop stop semantics.
- Trace emitter short-circuits further budget charges once a stop decision occurs to avoid duplicate breach events.
