      regression_tests_added: true
      coverage_notes: Stops at run/node scopes with no loop scenarios.
  design_rationales:
    - feature: Loop-aware FlowRunner budgeting
      principle: single responsibility
      summary: Separate helpers manage run, loop, and node scopes so FlowRunner coordinates policy + budget decisions without mutating shared state.
      risk_if_excluded: Loops would leak charges or miss stop signals, breaking budget guarantees.
      preferred_contexts: Multi-iteration flow execution where budgets span run/loop scopes.
    - feature: Immutable cost/value objects
      principle: immutability
      summary: CostSnapshot and BudgetDecision freeze payloads before trace emission to prevent accidental mutation across observers.
      risk_if_excluded: Trace consumers or adapters could mutate historical data causing audit drift.
      preferred_contexts: Any budgeting or telemetry surface that shares payloads with untrusted sinks.
  refactor_candidates:
    - from_branch: codex/implement-phase-3-using-tdd-for-feature-bk4a29
      file: codex/code/phase3-budget-guards-d98ee6c7/pkgs/dsl/runner.py
      issue: FlowRunner handles adapter orchestration, policy stack management, and breach reporting in one method.
      suggested_fix: Split execution phases into discrete helpers (preflight, commit, teardown) before considering upstream merge.
      urgency: medium
