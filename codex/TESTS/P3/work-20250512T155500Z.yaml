  task_id: 07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration.yaml
  proposed_tests:
    - name: test_policy_violation_and_budget_breach_priority
      rationale: Ensure FlowRunner surfaces policy violations before soft budget warnings when both occur in the same node execution.
      source_module: codex/code/work/runner/flow_runner.py
      priority: high
    - name: test_trace_payload_schema_validation
      rationale: Validate emitted trace payloads against the DSL trace schema to catch future drift.
      source_module: codex/code/work/runner/trace.py
      priority: medium
    - name: test_loop_multiple_nodes_budget_accounting
      rationale: Cover loop bodies with multiple nodes to assert all scopes receive correct spend aggregation and stop semantics.
