review_summary:
  code_task: 07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration.yaml
  top_branch: codex/complete-phase-3-for-tdd-feature-rd6egz
  rationale:
    - Loop-aware execution covers run, loop, and node scopes with clear trace emission, matching spec semantics.
    - Budget domain is immutable and normalized, making tests deterministic and payload-safe.
  improvement_areas_identified:
    - Trace emitter lacks pluggable sinks present in other candidates; plan follow-up.
    - Production copy still needs relocation from sandbox path into pkgs/dsl package.
  high_quality_snippets:
    - file: codex/code/work/dsl/flow_runner.py
      reason: Clean separation of unit node execution and loop orchestration with budget previews prior to commit.
