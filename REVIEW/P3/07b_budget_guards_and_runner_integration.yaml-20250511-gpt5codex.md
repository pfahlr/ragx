# Phase 3 Review Notes â€” Task 07b_budget_guards_and_runner_integration

## Review Checklist
- [x] Budget dataclasses enforce immutability and float normalisation.
- [x] `BudgetManager.preflight` and `.commit` emit consistent breach payloads and stop semantics.
- [x] FlowRunner halts on preflight stop with deterministic reason codes.
- [x] PolicyStack emits both resolved and violation events through shared emitter.
- [x] Unit tests cover soft vs. hard budgets and policy/budget interaction traces.

## Reviewer Notes
- Consider extending warnings to include aggregate totals for better telemetry.
- Future integration should reconcile this simplified PolicyStack with the canonical DSL policy module.
- Ensure downstream consumers handle the optional `phase` key on `budget_breach` events introduced for preflight contexts.
