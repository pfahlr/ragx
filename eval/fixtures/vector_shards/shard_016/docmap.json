      "text": "# Punishment\n\nPunishment, commonly, is the imposition of an undesirable or unpleasant outcome upon an individual or group, meted out by an authority\u2014in contexts ranging from child discipline to criminal law\u2014as a deterrent to a particular action or behavior that is deemed undesirable. It is, however, possible to distinguish between various different understandings of what punishment is.\nThe reasoning for punishment may be to condition a child to avoid self-endangerment, to impose social conformity (in particular, in the contexts of compulsory education or military discipline), to defend norms, to protect against future harms (in particular, those from violent crime), and to maintain the law\u2014and respect for rule of law\u2014under which the social group is governed. Punishment may be self-inflicted as with self-flagellation and mortification of the flesh in the religious setting, but is most often a form of social coercion.\nThe unpleasant imposition may include a fine, penalty, or confinement, or be the removal or denial of something pleasant or desirable. The individual may be a person, or even an animal. The authority may be either a group or a single person, and punishment may be carried out formally under a system of law or informally in other kinds of social settings such as within a family. Negative or unpleasant impositions that are not authorized or that are administered without a breach of rules are not considered to be punishment as defined here. The study and practice of the punishment of crimes, particularly as it applies to imprisonment, is called penology, or, often in modern texts, corrections; in this context, the punishment process is euphemistically called \"correctional process\". Research into punishment often includes similar research into prevention.\nJustifications for punishment include retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, and incapacitation. The last could include such measures as isolation, in order to prevent the wrongdoer's having contact with potential victims, or the removal of a hand in order to make theft more difficult.\nIf only some of the conditions included in the definition of punishment are present, descriptions other than \"punishment\" may be considered more accurate. Inflicting something negative, or unpleasant, on a person or animal, without authority or not on the basis of a breach of rules is typically considered only revenge or spite rather than punishment. In addition, the word \"punishment\" is used as a metaphor, as when a boxer experiences \"punishment\" during a fight. In other situations, breaking a rule may be rewarded, and so receiving such a reward naturally does not constitute punishment. Finally the condition of breaking (or breaching) the rules must be satisfied for consequences to be considered punishment.\nPunishments differ in their degree of severity, and may include sanctions such as reprimands, deprivations of privileges or liberty, fines, incarcerations, ostracism, the infliction of pain, amputation and the death penalty.\nCorporal punishment refers to punishments in which physical pain is intended to be inflicted upon the transgressor.\nPunishments may be judged as fair or unfair in terms of their degree of reciprocity and proportionality to the offense.\nPunishment can be an integral part of socialization, and punishing unwanted behavior is often part of a system of pedagogy or behavioral modification which also includes rewards.\n\n\n## Definitions\n\n\nThere are a large number of different understandings of what punishment is.\n\n\n### In philosophy\nVarious philosophers have presented definitions of punishment. Conditions commonly considered necessary properly to describe an action as punishment are that\n\nit is imposed by an authority (single or multiple),\nit involves some loss to the supposed offender,\nit is in response to an offense and\nthe human (or other animal) to whom the loss is imposed should be deemed at least somewhat responsible for the offense.\n\n\n### In psychology\n\nIntroduced by B.F. Skinner, punishment has a more restrictive and technical definition in psychology. Along with reinforcement, it belongs under the operant conditioning category. Operant conditioning refers to learning with either punishment that discourages the measured behavior, or a reward that encourages the behavior.\nIn psychology, punishment is the reduction of a behavior via application of an unpleasant stimulus (\"positive punishment\") or removal of a pleasant stimulus (\"negative punishment\"). Extra chores or spanking are examples of positive punishment, while grounding a teenager or removing screen time privileges are examples of negative punishment.\nThe definition requires that punishment is only determined after the fact by the reduction in behavior; if the offending behavior of the subject does not decrease, it is not considered punishment. In operant conditioning terms, punishment does not need to involve any type of pain, fear, or physical actions; even a brief spoken expression of disapproval, or calmly telling a student that they answered a question incorrectly, is a type of punishment, if the result is a decrease in the behavior (e.g., a decrease in giving that wrong answer to that question). There is some conflation of punishment and aversives, though an aversion that does not decrease behavior is not considered punishment in psychology. Additionally, \"aversive stimulus\" is a label behaviorists generally apply to negative reinforcers (as in avoidance learning), rather than the punishers.\n\n\n### In socio-biology\nPunishment is sometimes called retaliatory or moralistic aggression; it has been observed in all species of social animals, leading evolutionary biologists to conclude that it is an evolutionarily stable strategy, selected because it favors cooperative behavior.\nHowever, other evolutionary biologists have argued against punishment to favour cooperation. Dreber et al. demonstrate that while the availability of costly punishment can enhance cooperative behavior, it does not improve the group's average payoff. Additionally, there is a significant negative relationship between the overall payoff and the employment of costly punishment. Individuals who achieve the highest total payoffs generally avoid using costly punishment. This indicates that employing costly punishment in cooperative games may be disadvantageous and suggests that it may have evolved for purposes other than promoting cooperation.\nAchieving a certain proportion of trust in the population can lead to self-governance without the need for punishment.\n\n\n=### Examples against sociobiological use=\nThere are also arguments against the notion of punishment requiring intelligence, based on studies of punishment in very small-brained animals such as insects. There is proof of honey bee workers with mutations that makes them fertile laying eggs only when other honey bees are not observing them, and that the few that are caught in the act are killed. This is corroborated by computer simulations proving that a few simple reactions well within mainstream views of the extremely limited intelligence of insects are sufficient to emulate the \"political\" behavior observed in great apes. The authors argue that this falsifies the claim that punishment evolved as a strategy to deal with individuals capable of knowing what they are doing.\nIn the case of more complex brains, the notion of evolution selecting for specific punishment of intentionally chosen breaches of rules and/or wrongdoers capable of intentional choices (for example, punishing humans for murder while not punishing lethal viruses) is subject to criticism from coevolution issues. That punishment of individuals with certain characteristics (including but, in principle, not restricted to mental abilities) selects against those characteristics, making evolution of any mental abilities considered to be the basis for penal responsibility impossible in populations subject to such selective punishment. Certain scientists argue that this disproves the notion of humans having a biological feeling of intentional transgressions deserving to be punished.\n\n\n## Scope of application\n\nPunishments are applied for various purposes, most generally, to encourage and enforce proper behavior as defined by society or family. Criminals are punished judicially, by fines, corporal punishment or custodial sentences such as prison; detainees risk further punishments for breaches of internal rules. Children, pupils and other trainees may be punished by their educators or instructors (mainly parents, guardians, or teachers, tutors and coaches)\u2014see Child discipline.\nSlaves, domestic and other servants were subject to punishment by their masters. Employees can still be subject to a contractual form of fine or demotion. Most hierarchical organizations, such as military and police forces, or even churches, still apply quite rigid internal discipline, even with a judicial system of their own (court martial, canonical courts).\nPunishment may also be applied on moral, especially religious, grounds, as in penance (which is voluntary) or imposed in a theocracy with a religious police (as in a strict Islamic state like Iran or under the Taliban) or (though not a true theocracy) by Inquisition.\n\n\n## Hell as punishment\n\nBelief that an individual's ultimate punishment is being sent by God, the highest authority, to an existence in Hell, a place believed to exist in the after-life, typically corresponds to sins committed during their life. Sometimes these distinctions are specific, with damned souls suffering for each sin committed (see for example Plato's myth of Er or Dante's The Divine Comedy), but sometimes they are general, with condemned sinners relegated to one or more chamber of Hell or to a level of suffering.\n\n\n## History and rationale\n\n\n\n### Seriousness of a crime; punishment that fits the crime\n\nA principle often mentioned with respect to the degree of punishment to be meted out is that the punishment should match the crime.\nOne standard for measurement is the degree to which a crime affects others or society. Measurements of the degree of seriousness of a crime have been developed.\nA felony is generally considered to be a crime of \"high seriousness\", while a misdemeanor is not.\n\n\n## Possible reasons for punishment\n\n\nThere are many possible reasons that might be given to justify or explain why someone ought to be punished; here follows a broad outline of typical, possibly conflicting, justifications.\n\n\n### Deterrence\nReasons given to justify punishment include that it is a measure to prevent people from committing an offense \u2014 deterring previous offenders from re-offending, and preventing those who may be contemplating an offence they have not committed from actually committing it. This punishment is intended to be sufficient that people would rather choose not to commit the crime than experience the punishment. The aim is to deter everyone in the community from committing offences.\nSome criminologists state that the number of people convicted for crime does not decrease as a result of more severe punishment and conclude that deterrence is ineffective. Other criminologists object to said conclusion, citing that while most people do not know the exact severity of punishment such as whether the sentence for murder is 40 years or life, most people still know the rough outlines such as the punishments for armed robbery or forcible rape being more severe than the punishments for driving too fast or misparking a car. These criminologists therefore argue that lack of deterring effect of increasing the sentences for already severely punished crimes say nothing about the significance of the existence of punishment as a deterring factor.\nSome criminologists argue that increasing the sentences for crimes can cause criminal investigators to give higher priority to said crimes so that a higher percentage of those committing them are convicted for them, causing statistics to give a false appearance of such crimes increasing. These criminologists argue that the use of statistics to gauge the efficiency of crime fighting methods are a danger of creating a reward hack that makes the least efficient criminal justice systems appear to be best at fighting crime, and that the appearance of deterrence being ineffective may be an example of this.\n\n\n### Rehabilitation\n\nSome punishment includes work to reform and rehabilitate the culprit so that they will not commit the offence again. This is distinguished from deterrence, in that the goal here is to change the offender's attitude to what they have done, and make them come to see that their behavior was wrong.\n\n\n### Incapacitation\n\nIncapacitation as a justification of punishment refers to the offender's ability to commit further offences being removed. Imprisonment separates offenders from the community, for example, Australia was a dumping ground for early British criminals. This was their way of removing or reducing the offenders ability to carry out certain crimes. The death penalty does this in a permanent (and irrevocable) way. In some societies, people who stole have been punished by having their hands amputated.\nCrewe however, has pointed out that for incapacitation of an offender to work, it must be the case that the offender would have committed a crime had they not been restricted in this way. Should the putative offender not be going to commit further crimes, then they have not been incapacitated. The more heinous crimes such as murders have the lowest levels of recidivism and hence are the least likely offences to be subject to incapacitative effects. Antisocial behaviour and the like display high levels of recidivism and hence are the kind of crimes most susceptible to incapacitative effects. It is shown by life-course studies that long sentences for burglaries amongst offenders in their late teens and early twenties fail to incapacitate when the natural reduction in offending due to ageing is taken into account: the longer the sentence, in these cases, the less the incapacitative effect.\n\n\n### Retribution\n\nCriminal activities typically give a benefit to the offender and a loss to the victim. Punishment has been justified as a measure of retributive justice, in which the goal is to try to rebalance any unjust advantage gained by ensuring that the offender also suffers a loss. Sometimes viewed as a way of \"getting even\" with a wrongdoer\u2014the suffering of the wrongdoer is seen as a desired goal in itself, even if it has no restorative benefits for the victim. One reason societies have administered punishments is to diminish the perceived need for retaliatory \"street justice\", blood feud, and vigilantism.\n\n\n### Restoration\n\nEspecially applied to minor offenses, punishment may take the form of the offender \"righting the wrong\", or making restitution to the victim. Community service or compensation orders are examples of this sort of penalty. In models of restorative justice, victims take an active role in a process with their offenders who are encouraged to take responsibility for their actions, \"to repair the harm they've done\u2014by apologizing, returning stolen money, or community service.\" The restorative justice approach aims to help the offender want to avoid future offences.\n\n\n### Education and denunciation\n\nPunishment can be explained by positive prevention theory to use the criminal justice system to teach people what are the social norms for what is correct, and acts as a reinforcement.\nPunishment can serve as a means for society to publicly express denunciation of an action as being criminal. Besides educating people regarding what is not acceptable behavior, it serves the dual function of preventing vigilante justice by acknowledging public anger, while concurrently deterring future criminal activity by stigmatizing the offender.\nThis is sometimes called the \"Expressive Theory\" of denunciation.\nThe pillory was a method for carrying out public denunciation.\nSome critics of the education and denunciation model cite evolutionary problems with the notion that a feeling for punishment as a social signal system evolved if punishment was not effective. The critics argue that some individuals spending time and energy and taking risks in punishing others, and the possible loss of the punished group members, would have been selected against if punishment served no function other than signals that could evolve to work by less risky means.\n\n\n### Unified theory\nA unified theory of punishment brings together multiple penal purposes\u2014such as retribution, deterrence and rehabilitation\u2014in a single, coherent framework. Instead of punishment requiring we choose between them, unified theorists argue that they work together as part of some wider goal such as the protection of rights.\n\n\n## Criticism\n\nSome people think that punishment as a whole is unhelpful and even harmful to the people that it is used against. Detractors argue that punishment is simply wrong, of the same design as \"two wrongs make a right\". Critics argue that punishment is simply revenge. Professor Deirdre Golash, author of The Case against Punishment: Retribution, Crime Prevention, and the Law, says:\n\nWe ought not to impose such harm on anyone unless we have a very good reason for doing so\u2026 The deliberate doing of harm in the mistaken belief that it promotes some greater good is the essence of tragedy. We would do well to ask whether the goods we seek in harming offenders are worthwhile, and whether the means we choose will indeed secure them. Golash also writes about imprisonment:\nImprisonment means, at minimum, the loss of liberty and autonomy, as well as many material comforts, personal security, and access to heterosexual relations. These deprivations, according to Gresham Sykes (who first identified them) \"together dealt 'a profound hurt' that went to 'the very foundations of the prisoner's being.\nBut these are only the minimum harms, suffered by the least vulnerable inmates in the best-run prisons. Most prisons are run badly, and in some, conditions are more squalid than in the worst of slums. In the District of Columbia jail, for example, inmates must wash their clothes and sheets in cell toilets because the laundry machines are broken. Vermin and insects infest the building, in which air vents are clogged with decades' accumulation of dust and grime. But even inmates in prisons where conditions are sanitary must still face the numbing boredom and emptiness of prison life\u2014a vast desert of wasted days in which little in the way of meaningful activity is possible.\n\n\n### Destructiveness to thinking and betterment\nThere are critics of punishment who argue that punishment aimed at intentional actions forces people to suppress their ability to act on intent. Advocates of this viewpoint argue that such suppression of intention causes the harmful behaviors to remain, making punishment counterproductive. These people suggest that the ability to make intentional choices should instead be treasured as a source of possibilities of betterment, citing that complex cognition would have been an evolutionarily useless waste of energy if it led to justifications of fixed actions and no change as simple inability to understand arguments would have been the most thrifty protection from being misled by them if arguments were for social manipulation, and reject condemnation of people who intentionally did bad things. Punishment can be effective in stopping undesirable employee behaviors such as tardiness, absenteeism or substandard work performance. However, punishment does not necessarily cause an employee to demonstrate a desirable behavior.\n\n\n## See also\n\n\n\n## Citations\n\n\n\n## References\n\n\"Punishment\" .

      "text": "# Reaction_formation\n\nIn psychoanalytic theory, reaction formation (German: Reaktionsbildung) is a defense mechanism in which emotions, desires and impulses that are anxiety-producing or unacceptable to the ego are mastered by exaggeration of the directly opposing tendency.\n\n\n## Theory\n\nReaction formation depends on the hypothesis that:\n\n[t]he instincts and their derivatives may be arranged as pairs of opposites: life versus death, construction versus destruction, action versus passivity, dominance versus submission, and so forth. When one of the instincts produces anxiety by exerting pressure on the ego either directly or by way of the superego, the ego may try to sidetrack the offending impulse by concentrating upon its opposite. For example, if feelings of hate towards another person make one anxious, the ego can facilitate the flow of love to conceal the hostility.\"\nWhere reaction-formation takes place, it is usually assumed that the original, rejected impulse does not vanish, but persists, unconscious, in its original infantile form. Thus, where love is experienced as a reaction formation against hate, we cannot say that love is substituted for hate, because the original aggressive feelings still exist underneath the affectionate exterior that merely masks the hate to hide it from awareness.\nIn a diagnostic setting, the existence of a reaction-formation rather than a 'simple' emotion would be suspected where exaggeration, compulsiveness and inflexibility were observed. For example,\n\n[r]eactive love protests too much; it is overdone, extravagant, showy, and affected. It is counterfeit, and [...] is usually easily detected. Another feature of a reaction formation is its compulsiveness. A person who is defending himself against anxiety cannot deviate from expressing the opposite of what he really feels. His love, for instance, is not flexible. It cannot adapt itself to changing circumstances as genuine emotions do; rather it must be constantly on display as if any failure to exhibit it would cause the contrary feeling to come to the surface.\nReaction formation is an effective form of disguise, and can be utilized in many forms. For example, \"solicitude may be a reaction-formation against cruelty, cleanliness against coprophilia\". An analyst might explain a client's unconditional pacifism as a reaction formation against their sadism. In addition, \n\n[h]igh ideals of virtue and goodness may be reaction formations against primitive object cathexes rather than realistic values that are capable of being lived up to. Romantic notions of chastity and purity may mask crude sexual desires, altruism may hide selfishness, and piety may conceal sinfulness.\nEven more counter-intuitively, according to this model\n\n[a] phobia is an example of a reaction formation. The person wants what he fears. He is not afraid of the object; he is afraid of the wish for the object. The reactive fear prevents the dreaded wish from being fulfilled.\nThe concept of reaction formation has been used to explain responses to external threats as well as internal anxieties. In the phenomenon described as Stockholm syndrome, a hostage or kidnap victim 'falls in love' with the feared and hated person who has complete power over them. Similarly, paradoxical reports exist of powerless and vulnerable inmates of Nazi camps creating 'favourites' among the guards and even collecting objects discarded by them. The mechanism of reaction formation is often characteristic of obsessional neuroses. When this mechanism is overused, especially during the formation of the ego, it can become a permanent character trait. This is often seen in those with obsessional character and obsessive personality disorders. This does not imply that its periodic usage is always obsessional, but that it can lead to obsessional behavior.\n\n\n## Research\n\nA few studies have found evidence for the existence of reaction formation. \nWomen who scored high on sex-related guilt feelings claimed lower arousal when exposed to erotic stimulus, but physiological measures showed higher than average sexual responses. When Caucasians who actually showed non-racist, egalitarian tendencies were told they scored high for racist tendencies, they gave more money to an African-American panhandler when leaving the testing lab than those who were not accused of harboring racist sentiments.\n\n\n## See also\n\n",

      "text": "# Receptive_aphasia\n\nWernicke's aphasia, also known as receptive aphasia, sensory aphasia, fluent aphasia, or posterior aphasia, is a type of aphasia in which individuals have difficulty understanding written and spoken language. Patients with Wernicke's aphasia demonstrate fluent speech, which is characterized by typical speech rate, intact syntactic abilities and effortless speech output. Writing often reflects speech in that it tends to lack content or meaning. In most cases, motor deficits (i.e. hemiparesis) do not occur in individuals with Wernicke's aphasia. Therefore, they may produce a large amount of speech without much meaning. Individuals with Wernicke's aphasia often suffer of anosognosia \u2013 they are unaware of their errors in speech and do not realize their speech may lack meaning. They typically remain unaware of even their most profound language deficits.\nLike many acquired language disorders, Wernicke's aphasia can be experienced in many different ways and to many different degrees. Patients diagnosed with Wernicke's aphasia can show severe language comprehension deficits; however, this is dependent on the severity and extent of the lesion. Severity levels may range from being unable to understand even the simplest spoken and/or written information to missing minor details of a conversation. Many diagnosed with Wernicke's aphasia have difficulty with repetition in words and sentences and/or working memory.\nWernicke's aphasia was named after German physician Carl Wernicke, who is credited with discovering the area of the brain responsible for language comprehension (Wernicke's area) and discovery of the condition which results from a lesion to this brain area (Wernicke's aphasia). Although Wernicke's area (left posterior superior temporal cortex) is known as the language comprehension area of the brain, defining the exact region of the brain is a more complicated issue. A 2016 study aimed to determine the reliability of current brain models of the language center of the brain. After asking a group of neuroscientists what portion of the brain they consider to be Wernicke's area, results suggested that the classic \"Wernicke-Lichtheim-Geschwind\" model is no longer adequate for defining the language areas of the brain. This is because this model was created using an old understanding of human brain anatomy and does not take into consideration  the cortical and subcortical structures responsible for language or the connectivity of brain areas necessary for production and comprehension of language. While there is not a well defined area of the brain for language comprehension, Wernicke's aphasia is a known condition causing difficulty with understanding language.\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\nThe following are common symptoms seen in patients with Wernicke's aphasia:\n\nImpaired comprehension: deficits in understanding (receptive) written and spoken language. This is because Wernicke's area is responsible for assigning meaning to the language that is heard, so if it is damaged, the brain cannot comprehend the information that is being received.\nPoor word retrieval: ability to retrieve target words is impaired. This is also referred to as anomia, and it is often classified into the following subsets:\nWord-selection anomia: this type of anomia describes patients who know the function of a certain object, and can single out the target object from a larger group of objects, but they do not have the ability to name the object. For example when shown different clothes items and asked to select the one meant to keep their head warm, they will correctly select the hat, but will not be able to state the name of the object. In some patients this type of anomia is specific to certain categories like colors or animals.\nSemantic anomia: unlike patients with word-selection anomia, patients exhibiting semantic anomia also lose the ability to correctly distinguish the function or use of a given object, along with not being able to provide the name of it. Therefore, even provided with both the name and function of an object, these patients still would not be able to correctly select it out of a group.\nDisconnection anomia or modality-specific anomia: this subset of anomia affects patients' ability to name or distinguish objects if they are presented through a certain sensory modality, and is caused by a disconnect between the given sensory cortex and the language centers of the brain. For example, a patient may be able to distinguish an apple from a banana when presented with their given smells, but not when they are presented the objects through only touch.\nPhonemic substitution anomia: describes patients that exhibit paraphasia when trying to name objects. This can result in patients either selecting incorrect phonemes, such as saying 'bad' when shown an image of a 'bat', or they may simply try to use non-real words, or neologisms.\nNeologisms: Neologism is a Greek-derived word meaning \"new word\". The term is used in this sense to mean invented non-words that have no relation to the target word.\nE.g. \"dorflur\" for \"shoe\"\nProduction of jargon: speech that lacks content, consists of typical intonation, and is structurally intact. Jargon can consist of a string of neologisms, as well as a combination of real words that do not make sense together in context. The jargon may include word salads.\nFluent speech: individuals with Wernicke's aphasia do not have difficulty with producing connected speech that flows. Although the connection of the words may be appropriate, the words they are using may not belong together or make sense (Jargon). Some patients with Wernicke's Aphasia experience logorrhea, which is also known as over fluency. These patients use an excessive amount of words when speaking or writing.\nAwareness: Individuals with Wernicke's aphasia are often not aware of their incorrect productions, which would further explain why they do not correct themselves when they produce jargon, paraphasias, or neologisms. Additionally, patients may become irritated or frustrated because others cannot understand what they are saying, but they believe their speech is completely comprehensible.\nParaphasias:\nPhonemic (literal) paraphasia: Errors in selecting phonemes. Involves the substitution, addition, omission, or rearrangement of sounds so that an error can be defined as sounding like the target word. Often, half of the word is still intact which allows for easy comparison to the appropriate, original word (E.g. \"bap\" for \"map\"). The more phonemic paraphasias in a word, the harder it is to understand, to the extent at which may become unidentifiable. Often, these unidentifiable words are known as neologisms.\nSemantic (verbal) paraphasia: Failure to select the proper words with which to convey their ideas. The word used is always a real word, however it may not always be directly or closely related to the word the patient is trying to convey. Can result in saying a word that is related to the target word in meaning or category (E.g. \"jet\" for \"helicopter\" or \"knife\" for \"fork\"). Other times, semantic paraphasias can result in empty speech, or the use of overly generic words such as \"thing\" or \"stuff\" to stand in for the word they cannot come up with. This leads to speech that contains real words but lacks any substantial meaning.\nCircumlocution: talking around the target word.\nE.g. \"uhhh it's white... it's flat... you write on it...\" (when referencing paper)\nPressured speech: Wernicke's patient's inclination to run on their speech. Often described as an overabundance of speech. Common in Wernicke's patients due to the ease at which they produce speech, circumlocution, and lack of self-monitoring.\nE.g. a clinician asks, \"What do you do at a supermarket?\" And the individual responds with \"Well, the supermarket is a place. It is a place with a lot of food. My favorite food is Italian food. At a supermarket, I buy different kinds of food. There are carts and baskets. Supermarkets have lots of customers, and workers...\"\nLack of hemiparesis: typically, no motor deficits are seen with a localized lesion in Wernicke's area.\nReduced retention span: reduced ability to retain information for extended periods of time.\nImpairments in reading and writing: impairments can be seen in both reading and writing with differing severity levels.\n\nDistinction from other types of aphasia/other conditions\n\nExpressive aphasia (non-fluent Broca's aphasia): this is generally considered the second main categorization of aphasia, where individuals have great difficulty forming complete sentences with generally only basic content words (leaving out words like \"is\" and \"the\"). Unlike Wernicke's aphasia, which causes patients to speak fluently, but producing a jumbled mix of nonsensical words, people with Broca's aphasia speak slowly, and typically in small sentences, yet they are much more able to convey the intended meaning of the sentence. Additionally, while people with Wernicke's aphasia typically are unaware of their confusing language and may get frustrated with the listener for not understanding them, people with Broca's aphasia are completely aware of their language difficulties and can sometimes become frustrated with themselves.\nGlobal aphasia: individuals have extreme difficulties with both expressive (producing language) and receptive (understanding language).\nAnomic aphasia: the biggest hallmark is one's poor word-finding abilities; one's speech is fluent and appropriate, but full of circumlocutions (evident in both writing and speech).\nConduction aphasia: individuals can comprehend what is being said and are fluent in spontaneous speech, but they cannot repeat what is being said to them.\nTranscortical sensory aphasia: individuals have impaired auditory comprehension with intact repetition and fluent speech.\nProgressive confluent aphasia: A form of frontotemporal dementia characterized by motor speech impairment, agrammatism, laborious speech, and apraxia of speech. It is understood that comprehension of speech and semantic memory are relatively preserved. Symptoms progress over time unlike many other aphasias where symptoms appear immediately after stroke.\nWernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome: A well described syndrome of neurological and cognitive problems that comprises both Wernicke's Encephalopathy (WE) and Korsakoff Syndrome (KS). It is often characterized by impairment in memory formation and is caused by long term thiamine deficiency.\n\n\n## Causes\n\nThe most common cause of Wernicke's aphasia is stroke. Strokes may occur when blood flow to the brain is completely interrupted or severely reduced. This has a direct effect on the amount of oxygen and nutrients being able to supply the brain, which causes brain cells to die within minutes.\nThe most common stroke that causes Wernicke's Aphasia is an ischemic stroke affecting the posterior temporal lobe of the dominant hemisphere of the brain.\n\"The middle cerebral arteries supply blood to the cortical areas involved in speech, language and swallowing. The left middle cerebral artery provides Broca's area, Wernicke's area, Heschl's gyrus, and the angular gyrus with blood\". Therefore, in patients with Wernicke's aphasia, there is typically an occlusion to the left middle cerebral artery.\nAs a result of the occlusion in the left middle cerebral artery, Wernicke's aphasia is most commonly caused by a lesion in the posterior superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area). This area is posterior to the primary auditory cortex (PAC) which is responsible for decoding individual speech sounds. Wernicke's primary responsibility is to assign meaning to these speech sounds. The extent of the lesion will determine the severity of the patients deficits related to language. Damage to the surrounding areas (perisylvian region) may also result in Wernicke's aphasia symptoms due to variation in individual neuroanatomical structure and any co-occurring damage in adjacent areas of the brain.\nAnother common cause of Wernicke's aphasia is encephalitis, specifically around the posterior superior temporal gyrus. Encephalitis is the inflammation of the brain, which can be a result of infection, autoimmune disorders, or chronic substance abuse, among others.\nOther causes of Wernicke's Aphasia include brain trauma, cerebral tumors, central nervous system (CNS) infections, and degenerative brain disorders.\nIn the case of brain tumors, infections, or degenerative brain disorders, examples in which damage to the brain can be ongoingly progressive, it is likely that the aphasia will coincidingly progress as well, and symptoms will worsen if the cause is not treated.\n\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nAphasia is usually first recognized by the physician who treats the person for his or her brain injury. Most individuals will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan to confirm the presence of a brain injury and to identify its precise location. In circumstances where a person is showing possible signs of aphasia, the physician will refer him or her to a speech-language pathologist (SLP) for a comprehensive speech and language evaluation. SLPs will examine the individual's ability to express him or herself through speech, understand language in written and spoken forms, write independently, and perform socially.\nThe American Speech, Language, Hearing Association (ASHA) states a comprehensive assessment should be conducted in order to analyze the patient's communication functioning on multiple levels; as well as the effect of possible communication deficits on activities of daily living. Typical components of an aphasia assessment include: case history, self report, oral-motor examination, language skills, identification of environmental and personal factors, and the assessment results. A comprehensive aphasia assessment includes both formal and informal measures.\nFormal assessments include:\n\nBoston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE): diagnoses the presence and type of aphasia, focusing on location of lesion and the underlying linguistic processes.  \nWestern Aphasia Battery \u2013 Revised (WAB): determines the presence, severity, and type of aphasia; and can also determine baseline abilities of patient.\nCommunication Activities of Daily Living - Second Edition (CADL-2): measures functional communication abilities; focuses on reading, writing, social interactions, and varying levels of communication.\nRevised Token Test (RTT): assess receptive language and auditory comprehension; focuses on patient's ability to follow directions.\nInformal assessments, which aid in the diagnosis of patients with suspected aphasia, include:\n\nConversational speech and language sample\nFamily interview\nCase history or medical chart review\nBehavioral observations\nDiagnostic information should be scored and analyzed appropriately. Treatment plans and individual goals should be developed based on diagnostic information, as well as patient and caregiver needs, desires, and priorities.\n\n\n## Treatment\n\nThere is currently no standardized treatment for Wernicke's Aphasia, meaning treatment varies from patient to patient depending on the severity of the lesion and the resulting deficits. In some patients, the first step of action is to attempt to treat the possible causes for the aphasia, such as removing a brain tumor, or treating a nervous system infection. This may not lessen the symptoms for the patient as damage to the brain is often already done, but it typically stops the aphasia from worsening. For the majority of patients with any kind of aphasia, speech and language therapy is the primary treatment. This focuses on improving language skills and learning how to communicate in various ways to allow their needs to be met. Since Wernicke's patients face comprehension deficits, they are often unaware of their condition and may pose unique challenges for their treatment because of this lack of awareness or concern for their deficit. Treatment plans are usually devised by a team of healthcare workers including a speech therapist, neuropsychologist, and a neurologist.\nAccording to Bates et al. (2005), \"the primary goal of rehabilitation is to prevent complications, minimize impairments, and maximize function\". The topics of intensity and timing of intervention are widely debated across various fields. Results are contradictory: some studies indicate better outcomes with early intervention, while other studies indicate starting therapy too early may be detrimental to the patient's recovery. Recent research suggests, that therapy be functional and focus on communication goals that are appropriate for the patient's individual lifestyle.\nSpecific treatment considerations for working with individuals with Wernicke's aphasia (or those who exhibit deficits in auditory comprehension) include using familiar materials, using shorter and slower utterances when speaking, giving direct instructions, and using repetition as needed.\n\n\n### Role of neuroplasticity in recovery\nNeuroplasticity is defined as the brain's ability to reorganize itself, lay new pathways, and rearrange existing ones, as a result of experience. Neuronal changes after damage to the brain such as collateral sprouting, increased activation of the homologous areas, and map extension demonstrate the brain's neuroplastic abilities. According to Thomson, \"Portions of the right hemisphere, extended left brain sites, or both have been shown to be recruited to perform language functions after brain damage. All of the neuronal changes recruit areas not originally or directly responsible for large portions of linguistic processing. Principles of neuroplasticity have been proven effective in neurorehabilitation after damage to the brain. These principles include: incorporating multiple modalities into treatment to create stronger neural connections, using stimuli that evoke positive emotion, linking concepts with simultaneous and related presentations, and finding the appropriate intensity and duration of treatment for each individual patient.\n\n\n### Auditory comprehension treatment\nAuditory comprehension is a primary focus in treatment for Wernicke's aphasia, as it is the main deficit related to this diagnosis. Therapy activities may include:\n\nSingle-word comprehension: A common treatment method used to support single-word comprehension skills is known as a pointing drill. Through this method, clinicians lay out a variety of images in front of a patient. The patient is asked to point to the image that corresponds to the word provided by the clinician.\nUnderstanding spoken sentences: \"Treatment to improve comprehension of spoken sentences typically consists of drills in which patients answer questions, follow directions or verify the meaning of sentences\".\nUnderstanding conversation: An effective treatment method to support comprehension of discourse includes providing a patient with a conversational sample and asking him or her questions about that sample. Individuals with less severe deficits in auditory comprehension may also be able to retell aspects of the conversation.\n\n\n### Word retrieval\nAnomia is consistently seen in aphasia, so many treatment techniques aim to help patients with word finding problems. One example of a semantic approach is referred to as semantic feature analyses. The process includes naming the target object shown in the picture and producing words that are semantically related to the target. Through production of semantically similar features, participants develop more skills in naming stimuli due to the increase in lexical activation.\n\n\n### Restorative therapy approach\nNeuroplasticity is a central component to restorative therapy to compensate for brain damage. This approach is especially useful in Wernicke's aphasia patients that have had a stroke to the left brain hemisphere.\nSchuell's stimulation approach is a main method in traditional aphasia therapy that follows principles to retrieve function in the auditory modality of language and influence surrounding regions through stimulation. The guidelines to have the most effective stimulation are as follows:\nAuditory stimulation of language should be intensive and always present when other language modalities are stimulated.\n\nThe stimulus should be presented at a difficulty level equal to or just below the patient's ability.\nSensory stimulation must be present and repeated throughout the treatment.\nEach stimulus applied should produce a response; if there is no response more stimulation cues should be provided.\nResponse to stimuli should be maximized to create more opportunities for success and feedback for the speech-language pathologist.\nThe feedback of the speech-language pathologist should promote further success and patient and encouragement.\nTherapy should follow an intensive and systemic method to create success by progressing in difficulty.\nTherapies should be varied and build off of mastered therapy tasks.\nSchuell's stimulation utilizes stimulation through therapy tasks beginning at a simplified task and progressing to become more difficult including:\n\nPoint to tasks. During these tasks the patient is directed to point to an object or multiple objects. As the skill is learned the level of complexity increases by increasing the number of objects the patient must point to.\nSimple: \"Point to the book.\"\nComplex: \"Point to the book and then to the ceiling after touching your ear.\"\nFollowing directions with objects. During these tasks the patient is instructed to follow the instruction of manually following directions that increase in complexity as the skill is learned.\nSimple: \"Pick up the book.\"\nComplex: \"Pick up the book and put it down on the bench after I move the cup.\"\nYes or no questions \u2013 This task requires the patient to respond to various yes or no questions that can range from simple to complex.\nParaphrasing and retelling \u2013 This task requires the patient to read a paragraph and, afterwards, paraphrase it aloud. This is the most complex of Schuell's stimulation tasks because it requires comprehension, recall, and communication.\n\n\n### Social approach to treatment\nThe social approach involves a collaborative effort on behalf of patients and clinicians to determine goals and outcomes for therapy that could improve the patient's quality of life. A conversational approach is thought to provide opportunities for development and the use of strategies to overcome barriers to communication. The main goals of this treatment method are to improve the patient's conversational confidence and skills in natural contexts using conversational coaching, supported conversations, and partner training.\n\nConversational coaching involves patients with aphasia and their speech language pathologists, who serve as a \"coach\" discussing strategies to approach various communicative scenarios. The \"coach\" will help the patient develop a script for a scenario (such as ordering food at a restaurant), and help the patient practice and perform the scenario in and out of the clinic while evaluating the outcome.\nSupported conversation also involves using a communicative partner who supports the patient's learning by providing contextual cues, slowing their own rate of speech, and increasing their message's redundancy to promote the patient's comprehension.\nAdditionally, it is important to include the families of patients with aphasia in treatment programs. Clinicians can teach family members how to support one another, and how to adjust their speaking patterns to facilitate their loved one's treatment and rehabilitation.\nSpeech devices, while not a treatment that can improve a patient's language skills, help the patient communicate with caregivers through the use of pictures or speech.\n\n\n### Clinical trials\nMore recently, researchers are developing medical treatments for aphasia using clinical trials for pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Some medications include drugs affecting the catecholaminergic system, nootropic drugs, and medications used to treat Alzheimer's disease. The non-pharmacological approaches include transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct stimulation.\n\n\n## Prognosis\n\nPrognosis is strongly dependent on the location and extent of the lesion (damage) to the brain. Many personal factors also influence how a person will recover, which include age, previous medical history, level of education, gender, and motivation. All of these factors influence the brain's ability to adapt to change, restore previous skills, and learn new skills. It is important to remember that all the presentations of Receptive Aphasia may vary. The presentation of symptoms and prognosis are both dependent on personal components related to the individual's neural organization before the stroke, the extent of the damage, and the influence of environmental and behavioral factors after the damage occurs. The quicker a diagnosis of a stroke is made by a medical team, the more positive the patient's recovery may be. A medical team will work to control the signs and symptoms of the stroke and rehabilitation therapy will begin to manage and recover lost skills. The rehabilitation team may consist of a certified speech-language pathologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, and the family or caregivers. The length of therapy will be different for everyone, but research suggests that intense therapy over a short amount of time can improve outcomes of speech and language therapy for patients with aphasia. Research is not suggesting the only way therapy should be administered, but gives insight on how therapy affects the patient's prognosis.\n\n\n## See also\n\nAgraphia\nLogorrhea (psychology)\nParagrammatism\n\n\n## References\n\n\n\n## Further reading\n\n",

      "text": "# Reinforcement\n\nIn behavioral psychology, reinforcement refers to consequences that increase the likelihood of an organism's future behavior, typically in the presence of a particular antecedent stimulus. For example, a rat can be trained to push a lever to receive food whenever a light is turned on; in this example, the light is the antecedent stimulus, the lever pushing is the operant behavior, and the food is the reinforcer. Likewise, a student that receives attention and praise when answering a teacher's question will be more likely to answer future questions in class; the teacher's question is the antecedent, the student's response is the behavior, and the praise and attention are the reinforcements. Punishment is the inverse to reinforcement, referring to any behavior that decreases the likelihood that a response will occur.  In operant conditioning terms, punishment does not need to involve any type of pain, fear, or physical actions; even a brief spoken expression of disapproval is a type of punishment.\nConsequences that lead to appetitive behavior such as subjective \"wanting\" and \"liking\" (desire and pleasure) function as rewards or positive reinforcement. There is also negative reinforcement, which involves taking away an undesirable stimulus. An example of negative reinforcement would be taking an aspirin to relieve a headache.\nReinforcement is an important component of operant conditioning and behavior modification. The concept has been applied in a variety of practical areas, including parenting, coaching, therapy, self-help, education, and management.\n\n\n## Terminology\n\n\nIn the behavioral sciences, the terms \"positive\" and \"negative\" refer when used in their strict technical sense to the nature of the action performed by the conditioner rather than to the responding operant's evaluation of that action and its consequence(s). \"Positive\" actions are those that add a factor, be it pleasant or unpleasant, to the environment, whereas \"negative\" actions are those that remove or withhold from the environment a factor of either type. In turn, the strict sense of \"reinforcement\" refers only to reward-based conditioning; the introduction of unpleasant factors and the removal or withholding of pleasant factors are instead referred to as \"punishment\", which when used in its strict sense thus stands in contradistinction to \"reinforcement\". Thus, \"positive reinforcement\" refers to the addition of a pleasant factor, \"positive punishment\" refers to the addition of an unpleasant factor, \"negative reinforcement\" refers to the removal or withholding of an unpleasant factor, and \"negative punishment\" refers to the removal or withholding of a pleasant factor.\nThis usage is at odds with some non-technical usages of the four term combinations, especially in the case of the term \"negative reinforcement\", which is often used to denote what technical parlance would describe as \"positive punishment\" in that the non-technical usage interprets \"reinforcement\" as subsuming both reward and punishment and \"negative\" as referring to the responding operant's evaluation of the factor being introduced. By contrast, technical parlance would use the term \"negative reinforcement\" to describe encouragement of a given behavior by creating a scenario in which an unpleasant factor is or will be present but engaging in the behavior results in either escaping from that factor or preventing its occurrence, as in Martin Seligman\u2019s experiment involving dogs learning to avoid electric shocks.\n\n\n## Overview\n\nB. F. Skinner was a well-known and influential researcher who articulated many of the theoretical constructs of reinforcement and behaviorism. Skinner defined reinforcers according to the change in response strength (response rate) rather than to more subjective criteria, such as what is pleasurable or valuable to someone. Accordingly, activities, foods or items considered pleasant or enjoyable may not necessarily be reinforcing (because they produce no increase in the response preceding them). Stimuli, settings, and activities only fit the definition of reinforcers if the behavior that immediately precedes the potential reinforcer increases in similar situations in the future; for example, a child who receives a cookie when he or she asks for one. If the frequency of \"cookie-requesting behavior\" increases, the cookie can be seen as reinforcing \"cookie-requesting behavior\". If however, \"cookie-requesting behavior\" does not increase the cookie cannot be considered reinforcing.\nThe sole criterion that determines if a stimulus is reinforcing is the change in probability of a behavior after administration of that potential reinforcer. Other theories may focus on additional factors such as whether the person expected a behavior to produce a given outcome, but in the behavioral theory, reinforcement is defined by an increased probability of a response.\nThe study of reinforcement has produced an enormous body of reproducible experimental results. Reinforcement is the central concept and procedure in special education, applied behavior analysis, and the experimental analysis of behavior and is a core concept in some medical and psychopharmacology models, particularly addiction, dependence, and compulsion.\n\n\n## History\n\nLaboratory research on reinforcement is usually dated from the work of Edward Thorndike, known for his experiments with cats escaping from puzzle boxes. A number of others continued this research, notably B.F. Skinner, who published his seminal work on the topic in The Behavior of Organisms, in 1938, and elaborated this research in many subsequent publications. Notably Skinner argued that positive reinforcement is superior to punishment in shaping behavior. Though punishment may seem just the opposite of reinforcement, Skinner claimed that they differ immensely, saying that positive reinforcement results in lasting behavioral modification (long-term) whereas punishment changes behavior only temporarily (short-term) and has many detrimental side-effects.\nA great many researchers subsequently expanded our understanding of reinforcement and challenged some of Skinner's conclusions. For example, Azrin and Holz defined punishment as a \u201cconsequence of behavior that reduces the future probability of that behavior,\u201d  and some studies have shown that positive reinforcement and punishment are equally effective in modifying behavior. Research on the effects of positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement and punishment continue today as those concepts are fundamental to learning theory and apply to many practical applications of that theory.\n\n\n## Operant conditioning\n\n\nThe term operant conditioning was introduced by Skinner to indicate that in his experimental paradigm, the organism is free to operate on the environment. In this paradigm, the experimenter cannot trigger the desirable response; the experimenter waits for the response to occur (to be emitted by the organism) and then a potential reinforcer is delivered. In the classical conditioning paradigm, the experimenter triggers (elicits) the desirable response by presenting a reflex eliciting stimulus, the unconditional stimulus (UCS), which they pair (precede) with a neutral stimulus, the conditional stimulus (CS).\nReinforcement is a basic term in operant conditioning. For the punishment aspect of operant conditioning, see punishment (psychology).\n\n\n### Positive reinforcement\nPositive reinforcement occurs when a desirable event or stimulus is presented as a consequence of a behavior and the chance that this behavior will manifest in similar environments increases.  For example, if reading a book is fun, then experiencing the fun  positively reinforces the behavior of reading fun books.  The person who receives the positive reinforcement (i.e., who has fun reading the book) will read more books to have more fun.\nThe high probability instruction (HPI) treatment is a behaviorist treatment based on the idea of positive reinforcement.\n\n\n### Negative reinforcement\nNegative reinforcement increases the rate of a behavior that avoids or escapes an aversive situation or stimulus. That is, something unpleasant is already happening, and the behavior helps the person avoid or escape the unpleasantness.  In contrast to positive reinforcement, which involves adding a pleasant stimulus, in negative reinforcement, the focus is on the removal of an unpleasant situation or stimulus.  For example, if someone feels unhappy, then they might engage in a behavior (e.g., reading books) to escape from the aversive situation (e.g., their unhappy feelings).  The success of that avoidant or escapist behavior in removing the unpleasant situation or stimulus reinforces the behavior.\nDoing something unpleasant to people to prevent or remove a behavior from happening again is punishment, not negative reinforcement. The main difference is that reinforcement always increases the likelihood of a behavior (e.g., channel surfing while bored temporarily alleviated boredom; therefore, there will be more channel surfing while bored), whereas punishment decreases it (e.g., hangovers are an unpleasant stimulus, so people learn to avoid the behavior that led to that unpleasant stimulus).\n\n\n### Extinction\nExtinction occurs when a given behavior is ignored (i.e. followed up with no consequence).  Behaviors disappear over time when they continuously receive no reinforcement. During a deliberate extinction, the targeted behavior spikes first (in an attempt to produce the expected, previously reinforced effects), and then declines over time. Neither reinforcement nor extinction need to be deliberate in order to have an effect on a subject's behavior.  For example, if a child reads books because they are fun, then the parents' decision to ignore the book reading will not remove the positive reinforcement (i.e., fun) the child receives from reading books.  However, if a child engages in a behavior to get attention from the parents, then the parents' decision to ignore the behavior will cause the behavior to go extinct, and the child will find a different behavior to get their parents' attention. \n\n\n### Reinforcement versus punishment\nReinforcers serve to increase behaviors whereas punishers serve to decrease behaviors; thus, positive reinforcers are stimuli that the subject will work to attain, and negative reinforcers are stimuli that the subject will work to be rid of or to end. The table below illustrates the adding and subtracting of stimuli (pleasant or aversive) in relation to reinforcement vs. punishment.\n\n\n### Further ideas and concepts\nDistinguishing between positive and negative reinforcement can be difficult and may not always be necessary. Focusing on what is being removed or added and how it affects behavior can be more helpful.\nAn event that punishes behavior for some may reinforce behavior for others.\nSome reinforcement can include both positive and negative features, such as a drug addict taking drugs for the added euphoria (positive reinforcement) and also to eliminate withdrawal symptoms (negative reinforcement).\nReinforcement in the business world is essential in driving productivity. Employees are constantly motivated by the ability to receive a positive stimulus, such as a promotion or a bonus. Employees are also driven by negative reinforcement, such as by eliminating unpleasant tasks.\nThough negative reinforcement has a positive effect in the short term for a workplace (i.e. encourages a financially beneficial action), over-reliance on a negative reinforcement hinders the ability of workers to act in a creative, engaged way creating growth in the long term.\n\n\n### Primary and secondary reinforcers\nA primary reinforcer, sometimes called an unconditioned reinforcer, is a stimulus that does not require pairing with a different stimulus in order to function as a reinforcer and most likely has obtained this function through the evolution and its role in species' survival. Examples of primary reinforcers include food, water, and sex. Some primary reinforcers, such as certain drugs, may mimic the effects of other primary reinforcers. While these primary reinforcers are fairly stable through life and across individuals, the reinforcing value of different primary reinforcers varies due to multiple factors (e.g., genetics, experience). Thus, one person may prefer one type of food while another avoids it. Or one person may eat much food while another eats very little. So even though food is a primary reinforcer for both individuals, the value of food as a reinforcer differs between them.\nA secondary reinforcer, sometimes called a conditioned reinforcer, is a stimulus or situation that has acquired its function as a reinforcer after pairing with a stimulus that functions as a reinforcer. This stimulus may be a primary reinforcer or another conditioned reinforcer (such as money). \nWhen trying to distinguish primary and secondary reinforcers in human examples, use the \"caveman test.\" If the stimulus is something that a caveman would naturally find desirable (e.g. candy) then it is a primary reinforcer. If, on the other hand, the caveman would not react to it (e.g. a dollar bill), it is a secondary reinforcer. As with primary reinforcers, an organism can experience satisfaction and deprivation with secondary reinforcers.\n\n\n### Other reinforcement terms\nA generalized reinforcer is a conditioned reinforcer that has obtained the reinforcing function by pairing with many other reinforcers and functions as a reinforcer under a wide-variety of motivating operations. (One example of this is money because it is paired with many other reinforcers).\nIn reinforcer sampling, a potentially reinforcing but unfamiliar stimulus is presented to an organism without regard to any prior behavior.\nSocially-mediated reinforcement involves the delivery of reinforcement that requires the behavior of another organism. For example, another person is providing the reinforcement.\nThe Premack principle is a special case of reinforcement elaborated by David Premack, which states that a highly preferred activity can be used effectively as a reinforcer for a less-preferred activity.\nReinforcement hierarchy is a list of actions, rank-ordering the most desirable to least desirable consequences that may serve as a reinforcer. A reinforcement hierarchy can be used to determine the relative frequency and desirability of different activities, and is often employed when applying the Premack principle.\nContingent outcomes are more likely to reinforce behavior than non-contingent responses. Contingent outcomes are those directly linked to a causal behavior, such a light turning on being contingent on flipping a switch. Note that contingent outcomes are not necessary to demonstrate reinforcement, but perceived contingency may increase learning.\nContiguous stimuli are stimuli closely associated by time and space with specific behaviors. They reduce the amount of time needed to learn a behavior while increasing its resistance to extinction.  Giving a dog a piece of food immediately after sitting is more contiguous with (and therefore more likely to reinforce) the behavior than a several minute delay in food delivery following the behavior.\nNoncontingent reinforcement refers to response-independent delivery of stimuli identified as reinforcers for some behaviors of that organism. However, this typically entails time-based delivery of stimuli identified as maintaining aberrant behavior, which decreases the rate of the target behavior. As no measured behavior is identified as being strengthened, there is controversy surrounding the use of the term noncontingent \"reinforcement\".\n\n\n## Natural and artificial reinforcement\n\nIn his 1967 paper, Arbitrary and Natural Reinforcement, Charles Ferster proposed classifying reinforcement into events that increase the frequency of an operant behavior as a natural consequence of the behavior itself, and events that affect frequency by their requirement of human mediation, such as in a token economy where subjects are rewarded for certain behavior by the therapist.\nIn 1970, Baer and Wolf developed the concept of \"behavioral traps.\" A behavioral trap requires only a simple response to enter the trap, yet once entered, the trap cannot be resisted in creating general behavior change. It is the use of a behavioral trap that increases a person's repertoire, by exposing them to the naturally occurring reinforcement of that behavior. Behavioral traps have four characteristics:\n\nThey are \"baited\" with desirable reinforcers that \"lure\" the student into the trap.\nOnly a low-effort response already in the repertoire is necessary to enter the trap.\nInterrelated contingencies of reinforcement inside the trap motivate the person to acquire, extend, and maintain targeted skills.\nThey can remain effective for long periods of time because the person shows few, if any, satiation effects.\nThus, artificial reinforcement can be used to build or develop generalizable skills, eventually transitioning to  naturally occurring reinforcement to maintain or increase the behavior. Another example is a social situation that will generally result from a specific behavior once it has met a certain criterion.\n\n\n## Intermittent reinforcement schedules\n\nBehavior is not always reinforced every time it is emitted, and the pattern of reinforcement strongly affects how fast an operant response is learned, what its rate is at any given time, and how long it continues when reinforcement ceases. The simplest rules controlling reinforcement are continuous reinforcement, where every response is reinforced, and extinction, where no response is reinforced. Between these extremes, more complex schedules of reinforcement specify the rules that determine how and when a response will be followed by a reinforcer.\nSpecific schedules of reinforcement reliably induce specific patterns of response, and these rules apply across many different species. The varying consistency and predictability of reinforcement is an important influence on how the different schedules operate. Many simple and complex schedules were investigated at great length by B.F. Skinner using pigeons.\n\n\n### Simple schedules\n\nRatio schedule \u2013 the reinforcement depends only on the number of responses the organism has performed.\nContinuous reinforcement (CRF) \u2013 a schedule of reinforcement in which every occurrence of the instrumental response (desired response) is followed by the reinforcer.\nSimple schedules have a single rule to determine when a single type of reinforcer is delivered for a specific response.\n\nFixed ratio (FR) \u2013 schedules deliver reinforcement after every nth response. An FR 1 schedule is synonymous with a CRF schedule.\n(ex. Every three times a rat presses a button, that rat receives a slice of cheese)\nVariable ratio schedule (VR) \u2013 reinforced on average every nth response, but not always on the nth response.\n(ex. Gamblers win 1 out every an 10 turns on a slot machine, however this is an average and they could hypothetically win on any given turn)\nFixed interval (FI) \u2013 reinforced after n amount of time.\n(ex. Every 10 minutes, a rat receives a slice of cheese when it presses a button. Eventually, the rat will learn to ignore the button until each 10 minute interval has elapsed)\nVariable interval (VI) \u2013 reinforced on an average of n amount of time, but not always exactly n amount of time.\n(ie. A radio host gives away concert tickets approximately every hour, but the exact minutes may vary)\nFixed time (FT) \u2013 Provides a reinforcing stimulus at a fixed time since the last reinforcement delivery, regardless of whether the subject has responded or not. In other words, it is a non-contingent schedule.\nVariable time (VT) \u2013 Provides reinforcement at an average variable time since last reinforcement, regardless of whether the subject has responded or not.\nSimple schedules are utilized in many differential reinforcement procedures:\n\nDifferential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA) - A conditioning procedure in which an undesired response is decreased by placing it on extinction or, less commonly, providing contingent punishment, while simultaneously providing reinforcement contingent on a desirable response. An example would be a teacher attending to a student only when they raise their hand, while ignoring the student when he or she calls out.\nDifferential reinforcement of other behavior (DRO) \u2013 Also known as omission training procedures, an instrumental conditioning procedure in which a positive reinforcer is periodically delivered only if the participant does something other than the target response. An example would be reinforcing any hand action other than nose picking.\nDifferential reinforcement of incompatible behavior (DRI) \u2013 Used to reduce a frequent behavior without punishing it by reinforcing an incompatible response. An example would be reinforcing clapping to reduce nose picking\nDifferential reinforcement of low response rate (DRL) \u2013 Used to encourage low rates of responding. It is like an interval schedule, except that premature responses reset the time required between behavior.\nDifferential reinforcement of high rate (DRH) \u2013 Used to increase high rates of responding. It is like an interval schedule, except that a minimum number of responses are required in the interval in order to receive reinforcement.\n\n\n=### Effects of different types of simple schedules=\nFixed ratio: activity slows after reinforcer is delivered, then response rates increase until the next reinforcer delivery (post-reinforcement pause).\nVariable ratio: rapid, steady rate of responding; most resistant to extinction.\nFixed interval: responding increases towards the end of the interval; poor resistance to extinction.\nVariable interval: steady activity results, good resistance to extinction.\nRatio schedules produce higher rates of responding than interval schedules, when the rates of reinforcement are otherwise similar.\nVariable schedules produce higher rates and greater resistance to extinction than most fixed schedules. This is also known as the Partial Reinforcement Extinction Effect (PREE).\nThe variable ratio schedule produces both the highest rate of responding and the greatest resistance to extinction (for example, the behavior of gamblers at slot machines).\nFixed schedules produce \"post-reinforcement pauses\" (PRP), where responses will briefly cease immediately following reinforcement, though the pause is a function of the upcoming response requirement rather than the prior reinforcement.\nThe PRP of a fixed interval schedule is frequently followed by a \"scallop-shaped\" accelerating rate of response, while fixed ratio schedules produce a more \"angular\" response.\nfixed interval scallop: the pattern of responding that develops with fixed interval reinforcement schedule, performance on a fixed interval reflects subject's accuracy in telling time.\nOrganisms whose schedules of reinforcement are \"thinned\" (that is, requiring more responses or a greater wait before reinforcement) may experience \"ratio strain\" if thinned too quickly. This produces behavior similar to that seen during extinction.\nRatio strain: the disruption of responding that occurs when a fixed ratio response requirement is increased too rapidly.\nRatio run: high and steady rate of responding that completes each ratio requirement. Usually higher ratio requirement causes longer post-reinforcement pauses to occur.\nPartial reinforcement schedules are more resistant to extinction than continuous reinforcement schedules.\nRatio schedules are more resistant than interval schedules and variable schedules more resistant than fixed ones.\nMomentary changes in reinforcement value lead to dynamic changes in behavior.\n\n\n### Compound schedules\nCompound schedules combine two or more different simple schedules in some way using the same reinforcer for the same behavior. There are many possibilities; among those most often used are:\n\nAlternative schedules \u2013 A type of compound schedule where two or more simple schedules are in effect and whichever schedule is completed first results in reinforcement.\nConjunctive schedules \u2013 A complex schedule of reinforcement where two or more simple schedules are in effect independently of each other, and requirements on all of the simple schedules must be met for reinforcement.\nMultiple schedules \u2013 Two or more schedules alternate over time, with a stimulus indicating which is in force. Reinforcement is delivered if the response requirement is met while a schedule is in effect.\nMixed schedules \u2013 Either of two, or more, schedules may occur with no stimulus indicating which is in force. Reinforcement is delivered if the response requirement is met while a schedule is in effect.\nConcurrent schedules \u2013 A complex reinforcement procedure in which the participant can choose any one of two or more simple reinforcement schedules that are available simultaneously. Organisms are free to change back and forth between the response alternatives at any time.\nConcurrent-chain schedule of reinforcement' \u2013 A complex reinforcement procedure in which the participant is permitted to choose during the first link which of several simple reinforcement schedules will be in effect in the second link. Once a choice has been made, the rejected alternatives become unavailable until the start of the next trial.\nInterlocking schedules \u2013 A single schedule with two components where progress in one component affects progress in the other component. In an interlocking FR 60 FI 120-s schedule, for example, each response subtracts time from the interval component such that each response is \"equal\" to removing two seconds from the FI schedule.\nChained schedules \u2013 Reinforcement occurs after two or more successive schedules have been completed, with a stimulus indicating when one schedule has been completed and the next has started\nTandem schedules \u2013 Reinforcement occurs when two or more successive schedule requirements have been completed, with no stimulus indicating when a schedule has been completed and the next has started.\nHigher-order schedules \u2013 completion of one schedule is reinforced according to a second schedule; e.g. in FR2 (FI10 secs), two successive fixed interval schedules require completion before a response is reinforced.\n\n\n### Superimposed schedules\n\nThe psychology term superimposed schedules of reinforcement refers to a structure of rewards where two or more simple schedules of reinforcement operate simultaneously. Reinforcers can be positive, negative, or both. An example is a person who comes home after a long day at work. The behavior of opening the front door is rewarded by a big kiss on the lips by the person's spouse and a rip in the pants from the family dog jumping enthusiastically. Another example of superimposed schedules of reinforcement is a pigeon in an experimental cage pecking at a button. The pecks deliver a hopper of grain every 20th peck, and access to water after every 200 pecks.\nSuperimposed schedules of reinforcement are a type of compound schedule that evolved from the initial work on simple schedules of reinforcement by B.F. Skinner and his colleagues (Skinner and Ferster, 1957). They demonstrated that reinforcers could be delivered on schedules, and further that organisms behaved differently under different schedules. Rather than a reinforcer, such as food or water, being delivered every time as a consequence of some behavior, a reinforcer could be delivered after more than one instance of the behavior. For example, a pigeon may be required to peck a button switch ten times before food appears. This is a \"ratio schedule\". Also, a reinforcer could be delivered after an interval of time passed following a target behavior. An example is a rat that is given a food pellet immediately following the first response that occurs after two minutes has elapsed since the last lever press. This is called an \"interval schedule\".\nIn addition, ratio schedules can deliver reinforcement following fixed or variable number of behaviors by the individual organism. Likewise, interval schedules can deliver reinforcement following fixed or variable intervals of time following a single response by the organism. Individual behaviors tend to generate response rates that differ based upon how the reinforcement schedule is created. Much subsequent research in many labs examined the effects on behaviors of scheduling reinforcers.\nIf an organism is offered the opportunity to choose between or among two or more simple schedules of reinforcement at the same time, the reinforcement structure is called a \"concurrent schedule of reinforcement\". Brechner (1974, 1977) introduced the concept of superimposed schedules of reinforcement in an attempt to create a laboratory analogy of social traps, such as when humans overharvest their fisheries or tear down their rainforests. Brechner created a situation where simple reinforcement schedules were superimposed upon each other. In other words, a single response or group of responses by an organism led to multiple consequences. Concurrent schedules of reinforcement can be thought of as \"or\" schedules, and superimposed schedules of reinforcement can be thought of as \"and\" schedules. Brechner and Linder (1981) and Brechner (1987) expanded the concept to describe how superimposed schedules and the social trap analogy could be used to analyze the way energy flows through systems.\nSuperimposed schedules of reinforcement have many real-world applications in addition to generating social traps. Many different human individual and social situations can be created by superimposing simple reinforcement schedules. For example, a human being could have simultaneous tobacco and alcohol addictions. Even more complex situations can be created or simulated by superimposing two or more concurrent schedules. For example, a high school senior could have a choice between going to Stanford University or UCLA, and at the same time have the choice of going into the Army or the Air Force, and simultaneously the choice of taking a job with an internet company or a job with a software company. That is a reinforcement structure of three superimposed concurrent schedules of reinforcement.\nSuperimposed schedules of reinforcement can create the three classic conflict situations (approach\u2013approach conflict, approach\u2013avoidance conflict, and avoidance\u2013avoidance conflict) described by Kurt Lewin (1935) and can operationalize other Lewinian situations analyzed by his force field analysis. Other examples of the use of superimposed schedules of reinforcement as an analytical tool are its application to the contingencies of rent control (Brechner, 2003) and problem of toxic waste dumping in the Los Angeles County storm drain system (Brechner, 2010).\n\n\n### Concurrent schedules\nIn operant conditioning, concurrent schedules of reinforcement are schedules of reinforcement that are simultaneously available to an animal subject or human participant, so that the subject or participant can respond on either schedule. For example, in a two-alternative forced choice task, a pigeon in a Skinner box is faced with two pecking keys; pecking responses can be made on either, and food reinforcement might follow a peck on either. The schedules of reinforcement arranged for pecks on the two keys can be different. They may be independent, or they may be linked so that behavior on one key affects the likelihood of reinforcement on the other.\nIt is not necessary for responses on the two schedules to be physically distinct. In an alternate way of arranging concurrent schedules, introduced by Findley in 1958, both schedules are arranged on a single key or other response device, and the subject can respond on a second key to change between the schedules. In such a \"Findley concurrent\" procedure, a stimulus (e.g., the color of the main key) signals which schedule is in effect.\nConcurrent schedules often induce rapid alternation between the keys. To prevent this, a \"changeover delay\" is commonly introduced: each schedule is inactivated for a brief period after the subject switches to it.\nWhen both the concurrent schedules are variable intervals, a quantitative relationship known as the matching law is found between relative response rates in the two schedules and the relative reinforcement rates they deliver; this was first observed by R.J. Herrnstein in 1961. Matching law is a rule for instrumental behavior which states that the relative rate of responding on a particular response alternative equals the relative rate of reinforcement for that response (rate of behavior = rate of reinforcement). Animals and humans have a tendency to prefer choice in schedules.\n\n\n## Shaping\n\n\nShaping is the reinforcement of successive approximations to a desired instrumental response. In training a rat to press a lever, for example, simply turning toward the lever is reinforced at first. Then, only turning and stepping toward it is reinforced. Eventually the rat will be reinforced for pressing the lever. The successful attainment of one behavior starts the shaping process for the next. As training progresses, the response becomes progressively more like the desired behavior, with each subsequent behavior becoming a closer approximation of the final behavior.\nThe intervention of shaping is used in many training situations, and also for individuals with autism as well as other developmental disabilities. When shaping is combined with other evidence-based practices such as Functional Communication Training (FCT), it can yield positive outcomes for human behavior. Shaping typically uses continuous reinforcement, but the response can later be shifted to an intermittent reinforcement schedule.\nShaping is also used for food refusal. Food refusal is when an individual has a partial or total aversion to food items. This can be as minimal as being a picky eater to so severe that it can affect an individual's health. Shaping has been used to have a high success rate for food acceptance.\n\n\n## Chaining\n\n\nChaining involves linking discrete behaviors together in a series, such that the consequence of each behavior is both the reinforcement for the previous behavior, and the antecedent stimulus for the next behavior. There are many ways to teach chaining, such as forward chaining (starting from the first behavior in the chain), backwards chaining (starting from the last behavior) and total task chaining (teaching each behavior in the chain simultaneously). People's morning routines are a typical chain, with a series of behaviors (e.g. showering, drying off, getting dressed) occurring in sequence as a well learned habit.\nChallenging behaviors seen in individuals with autism and other related disabilities have successfully managed and maintained in studies using a scheduled of chained reinforcements. Functional communication training is an intervention that often uses chained schedules of reinforcement to effectively promote the appropriate and desired functional communication response.\n\n\n## Mathematical models\n\n\nThere has been research on building a mathematical model of reinforcement. This model is known as MPR, which is short for mathematical principles of reinforcement. Peter Killeen has made key discoveries in the field with his research on pigeons.\n\n\n## Applications\n\nReinforcement and punishment are ubiquitous in human social interactions, and a great many applications of operant principles have been suggested and implemented. Following are a few examples.\n\n\n### Addiction and dependence\nPositive and negative reinforcement play central roles in the development and maintenance of addiction and drug dependence. An addictive drug is intrinsically rewarding; that is, it functions as a primary positive reinforcer of drug use. The brain's reward system assigns it incentive salience (i.e., it is \"wanted\" or \"desired\"), so as an addiction develops, deprivation of the drug leads to craving.  In addition, stimuli associated with drug use \u2013 e.g., the sight of a syringe, and the location of use \u2013 become associated with the intense reinforcement induced by the drug. These previously neutral stimuli acquire several properties: their appearance can induce craving, and they can become conditioned positive reinforcers of continued use. Thus, if an addicted individual encounters one of these drug cues, a craving for the associated drug may reappear. For example, anti-drug agencies previously used posters with images of drug paraphernalia as an attempt to show the dangers of drug use. However, such posters are no longer used because of the effects of incentive salience in causing relapse upon sight of the stimuli illustrated in the posters.\nIn drug dependent individuals, negative reinforcement occurs when a drug is self-administered in order to alleviate or \"escape\" the symptoms of physical dependence (e.g., tremors and sweating) and/or psychological dependence (e.g., anhedonia, restlessness, irritability, and anxiety) that arise during the state of drug withdrawal.\n\n\n### Animal training\n\nAnimal trainers and pet owners were applying the principles and practices of operant conditioning long before these ideas were named and studied, and animal training still provides one of the clearest and most convincing examples of operant control. Of the concepts and procedures described in this article, a few of the most salient are: availability of immediate reinforcement (e.g. the ever-present bag of dog yummies); contingency, assuring that reinforcement follows the desired behavior and not something else; the use of secondary reinforcement, as in sounding a clicker immediately after a desired response; shaping,  as in gradually getting a dog to jump higher and higher;  intermittent reinforcement,  reducing the frequency of those yummies to induce persistent behavior without satiation; chaining, where a complex behavior is gradually put together.\n\n\n### Child behavior \u2013 parent management training\n\nProviding positive reinforcement for appropriate child behaviors is a major focus of parent management training. Typically, parents learn to reward appropriate behavior through social rewards (such as praise, smiles, and hugs) as well as concrete rewards (such as stickers or points towards a larger reward as part of an incentive system created collaboratively with the child). In addition, parents learn to select simple behaviors as an initial focus and reward each of the small steps that their child achieves towards reaching a larger goal (this concept is called \"successive approximations\"). They may also use indirect rewards such through progress charts. Providing positive reinforcement in the classroom can be beneficial to student success. When applying positive reinforcement to students, it's crucial to make it individualized to that student's needs. This way, the student understands why they are receiving the praise, they can accept it, and eventually learn to continue the action that was earned by positive reinforcement. For example, using rewards or extra recess time might apply to some students more, whereas others might accept the enforcement by receiving stickers or check marks indicating praise.\n\n\n### Economics\n\nBoth psychologists and economists have become interested in applying operant concepts and findings to the behavior of humans in the marketplace. An example\nis the analysis of consumer demand, as indexed by the amount of a commodity that is purchased. In economics, the degree to which price influences consumption is called \"the price elasticity of demand.\" Certain commodities are more elastic than others; for example, a change in price of certain foods may have a large effect on the amount bought, while gasoline and other essentials may be less affected by price changes. In terms of operant analysis, such effects may be interpreted in terms of motivations of consumers and the relative value of the commodities as reinforcers.\n\n\n### Gambling \u2013 variable ratio scheduling\n\nAs stated earlier in this article, a variable ratio schedule yields reinforcement after the emission of an unpredictable number of responses.  This schedule typically generates rapid, persistent responding. Slot machines pay off on a variable ratio schedule, and they produce just this sort of persistent lever-pulling behavior in gamblers.  Because the machines are programmed to pay out less money than they take in, the persistent slot-machine user invariably loses in the long run.  Slots machines, and thus variable ratio reinforcement, have often been blamed as a factor underlying gambling addiction.\n\n\n### Praise\n\nThe concept of praise as a means of behavioral reinforcement in humans is rooted in B.F. Skinner's model of operant conditioning. Through this lens, praise has been viewed as a means of positive reinforcement, wherein an observed behavior is made more likely to occur by contingently praising said behavior.  Hundreds of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of praise in promoting positive behaviors, notably in the study of teacher and parent use of praise on child in promoting improved behavior and academic performance, but also in the study of work performance. Praise has also been demonstrated to reinforce positive behaviors in non-praised adjacent individuals (such as a classmate of the praise recipient) through vicarious reinforcement. Praise may be more or less effective in changing behavior depending on its form, content and delivery. In order for praise to effect positive behavior change, it must be contingent on the positive behavior (i.e., only administered after the targeted behavior is enacted), must specify the particulars of the behavior that is to be reinforced, and must be delivered sincerely and credibly.\nAcknowledging the effect of praise as a positive reinforcement strategy, numerous behavioral and cognitive behavioral interventions have incorporated the use of praise in their protocols. The strategic use of praise is recognized as an evidence-based practice in both classroom management and parenting training interventions, though praise is often subsumed in intervention research into a larger category of positive reinforcement, which includes strategies such as strategic attention and behavioral rewards.\n\n\n### Traumatic bonding\n\nTraumatic bonding occurs as the result of ongoing cycles of abuse in which the intermittent reinforcement of reward and punishment creates powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change.\nThe other source indicated that \n\n'The necessary conditions for traumatic bonding are that one person must dominate the other and that the level of abuse chronically spikes and then subsides. The relationship is characterized by periods of permissive, compassionate, and even affectionate behavior from the dominant person, punctuated by intermittent episodes of intense abuse. To maintain the upper hand, the victimizer manipulates the behavior of the victim and limits the victim's options so as to perpetuate the power imbalance. Any threat to the balance of dominance and submission may be met with an escalating cycle of punishment ranging from seething intimidation to intensely violent outbursts. The victimizer also isolates the victim from other sources of support, which reduces the likelihood of detection and intervention, impairs the victim's ability to receive countervailing self-referent feedback, and strengthens the sense of unilateral dependency ... The traumatic effects of these abusive relationships may include the impairment of the victim's capacity for accurate self-appraisal, leading to a sense of personal inadequacy and a subordinate sense of dependence upon the dominating person. Victims also may encounter a variety of unpleasant social and legal consequences of their emotional and behavioral affiliation with someone who perpetrated aggressive acts, even if they themselves were the recipients of the aggression.\n\n\n### Video games\n\nMost video games are designed around some type of compulsion loop, adding a type of positive reinforcement through a variable rate schedule to keep the player playing the game, though this can also lead to video game addiction.\n\nAs part of a trend in the monetization of video games in the 2010s, some games offered \"loot boxes\" as rewards or purchasable by real-world funds that offered a random selection of in-game items, distributed by rarity. The practice has been tied to the same methods that slot machines and other gambling devices dole out rewards, as it follows a variable rate schedule. While the general perception that loot boxes are a form of gambling, the practice is only classified as such in a few countries as gambling and otherwise legal. However, methods to use those items as virtual currency for online gambling or trading for real-world money has created a skin gambling market that is under legal evaluation.\n\n\n## Criticisms\n\nThe standard definition of behavioral reinforcement has been criticized as circular, since it appears to argue that response strength is increased by reinforcement, and defines reinforcement as something that increases response strength (i.e., response strength is increased by things that increase response strength). However, the correct usage of reinforcement is that something is a reinforcer because of its effect on behavior, and not the other way around. It becomes circular if one says that a particular stimulus strengthens behavior because it is a reinforcer, and does not explain why a stimulus is producing that effect on the behavior. Other definitions have been proposed, such as F.D. Sheffield's \"consummatory behavior contingent on a response\", but these are not broadly used in psychology.\nIncreasingly, understanding of the role reinforcers play is moving away from a \"strengthening\" effect to a \"signalling\" effect. That is, the view that reinforcers increase responding because they signal the behaviors that are likely to result in reinforcement.  While in most practical applications, the effect of any given reinforcer will be the same regardless of whether the reinforcer is signalling or strengthening, this approach helps to explain a number of behavioral phenomena including patterns of responding on intermittent reinforcement schedules (fixed interval scallops) and the differential outcomes effect. \n\n\n## See also\n\n\n\n## References\n\n\n\n## Further reading\n\n\n\n## External links\n\n",

      "text": "# Repression_(psychoanalysis)\n\nRepression is a key concept of psychoanalysis, where it is understood as a defense mechanism that \"ensures that what is unacceptable to the conscious mind, and would if recalled arouse anxiety, is prevented from entering into it.\" According to psychoanalytic theory, repression plays a major role in many mental illnesses, and in the psyche of the average person.\nAmerican psychologists began to attempt to study repression in the experimental laboratory around 1930. However, psychoanalysts were at first uninterested in attempts to study repression in laboratory settings, and later came to reject them. Most psychoanalysts concluded that such attempts misrepresented the psychoanalytic concept of repression.\n\n\n## Sigmund Freud's theory\n\nThe founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, in seeking to move away from hypnosis and towards encouraging patients to remember their past in a conscious state, observed that the process was strikingly difficult, and he began to suspect that there was some sort of psychic mechanism intervening to prevent access to consciousness. The intensity of his struggles to get patients to recall past events led him to conclude that there was some force that \"prevented them from becoming conscious and compelled them to remain unconscious\", and which actively \"pushed the pathogenetic experiences in question out of consciousness.\" Freud gave the name of repression to this hypothetical process. He would later call the theory of repression \"the corner-stone on which the whole structure of psychoanalysis rests\" (\"On the History of the Psycho-Analytic Movement\").\nThe psychologist and founder of pedagogy, Johann Friedrich Herbart, whose ideas had influenced Freud's psychiatry teacher Theodor Meynert, had used the term 'repression' as early as 1824, in a discussion of unconscious ideas competing to get into consciousness.\n\n\n### Stages\nFreud considered that there was \"reason to assume that there is a primal repression, a first phase of repression, which consists in the psychical (ideational) representative of the instinct being denied entrance into the conscious\", as well as a second stage of repression, repression proper (an \"after-pressure\"), which affects mental derivatives of the repressed representative.\nIn the primary repression phase, \"it is highly probable that the immediate precipitating causes of primal repressions are quantitative factors such as ... the earliest outbreaks of anxiety, which are of a very intense kind\". The child realizes that acting on some desires may bring anxiety. This anxiety leads to repression of the desire.\nWhen it is internalized, the threat of punishment related to this form of anxiety becomes the superego, which intercedes against the desires of the id (which works on the basis of the pleasure principle). Freud speculated that \"it is perhaps the emergence of the super-ego which provides the line of demarcation between primal repression and after-pressure\".\n\n\n### Therapy\nNeurosis may occur when the personality develops under the influence of the superego and the pressure of the repressed impulses, leading to behavior that is irrational, self-destructive, or antisocial.\nA psychoanalyst may try to ameliorate this behavior by seeking to discover the repressed aspects of the patient's mental processes and reintroducing them to their conscious awareness - \"assuming the role of mediator and peacemaker ... to lift the repression\".\n\n\n### Reactions\nThe philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre maintained that there is no \"mechanism\" that represses unwanted thoughts. Since \"all consciousness is conscious of itself\" we will be aware of the process of repression, even if skilfully dodging an issue. The philosopher Thomas Baldwin stated in The Oxford Companion to Philosophy (1995) that Sartre's argument that Freud's theory of repression is internally flawed is based on a misunderstanding of Freud. The philosopher Roger Scruton argued in Sexual Desire (1986) that Freud's theory of repression disproves the claim, made by Karl Popper and Ernest Nagel, that Freudian theory implies no testable observation and therefore does not have genuine predictive power, since the theory has \"strong empirical content\" and implies testable consequences.\n\n\n## Later developments\n\nThe psychoanalyst Otto Fenichel stressed that 'if the disappearance of the original aim from consciousness is called repression, every sublimation is a repression (a \"successful\" one: through the new type of discharge, the old one has become superfluous)'.\nThe psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan stressed the role of the signifier in repression \u2014 'the primal repressed is a signifier' \u2014 examining how the symptom is 'constituted on the basis of primal repression, of the fall, of the Unterdr\u00fcckung, of the binary signifier ... the necessary fall of this first signifier'.\nFamily therapy has explored how familial taboos lead to 'this screening-off that Freud called \"repression\"', emphasising the way that 'keeping part of ourselves out of our awareness is a very active process ... a deliberate hiding of some feeling from our family'.\n\n\n## Experimental attempts to study repression\n\nAccording to the psychologist Donald W. MacKinnon and his co-author William F. Dukes, American psychologists began to attempt to study repression in the experimental laboratory around 1930. These psychologists were influenced by an exposition of the concept of repression published by the psychoanalyst Ernest Jones in the American Journal of Psychology in 1911. Like other psychologists who attempted to submit the claims of psychoanalysis to experimental test, they did not immediately try to develop new techniques for that purpose, instead conducting surveys of the psychological literature to see whether \"experiments undertaken to test other theoretical assertions\" had produced results relevant to assessing psychoanalysis. In 1930, H. Meltzer published a survey of experimental literature on \"the relationships between feeling and memory\" in an attempt to determine the relevance of laboratory findings to \"that aspect of the theory of repression which posits a relationship between hedonic tone and conscious memory.\" However, according to MacKinnon and Dukes, because Meltzer had an inadequate grasp of psychoanalytic writing he misinterpreted Freud's view that the purpose of repression is to avoid \"unpleasure\", taking the term to mean simply something unpleasant, whereas for Freud it actually meant deep-rooted anxiety. Nevertheless, Meltzer pointed out shortcomings in the studies he reviewed, and in MacKinnon and Dukes's view he also \"recognized that most of the investigations which he reviewed had not been designed specifically to test the Freudian theory of repression.\"\nIn 1934, the psychologist Saul Rosenzweig and his co-author G. Mason criticized Meltzer, concluding that the studies he reviewed suffered from two basic problems: that the studies \"worked with hedonic tone associated with sensory stimuli unrelated to the theory of repression rather than with conative hedonic tone associated with frustrated striving, which is the only kind of 'unpleasantnesss' which, according to the Freudian theory, leads to repression\" and that they \"failed to develop under laboratory control the experiences which are subsequently to be tested for recall\". In MacKinnon and Dukes's view, psychologists who wanted to study repression in the laboratory \"faced the necessity of becoming clear about the details of the psychoanalytic formulation of repression if their researches were to be adequate tests of the theory\" but soon discovered that \"to grasp clearly even a single psychoanalytic concept was an almost insurmountable task.\" MacKinnon and Dukes attribute this situation to the way in which Freud repeatedly modified his theory \"without ever stating clearly just which of his earlier formulations were to be completely discarded, or if not discarded, how they were to be understood in the light of his more recent assertions.\"\nMacKinnon and Dukes write that, while psychoanalysts were at first only disinterested in attempts to study repression in laboratory settings, they later came to reject them. They comment that while \"the psychologists had criticized each other's researches largely on the grounds that their experimental techniques and laboratory controls had not been fully adequate, the psychoanalysts rejected them on the more sweeping grounds that whatever else these researches might be they simply were not investigations of repression.\" They relate that in 1934, when Freud was sent reprints of Rosenzweig's attempts to study repression, he responded with a dismissive letter stating that \"the wealth of reliable observations\" on which psychoanalytic assertions were based made them \"independent of experimental verification.\" In the same letter, Freud concluded that Rosenzweig's studies \"can do no harm.\" MacKinnon and Dukes describe Freud's conclusion as a \"first rather casual opinion\", and state that most psychoanalysts eventually adopted a contrary view, becoming convinced that \"such studies could indeed be harmful since they misrepresented what psychoanalysts conceived repression to be.\"\nWriting in 1962, MacKinnon and Dukes state that experimental studies \"conducted during the last decade\" have largely abandoned the term \"repression\", choosing instead to refer to the phenomenon as \"perceptual defense\". They argue that this change of terminology has had a major effect on how the phenomenon is understood, and that psychoanalysts, who had attacked earlier studies of repression, did not criticize studies of perceptual defense in a similar fashion, instead neglecting them. They concluded by noting that psychologists remained divided in their view of repression, some regarding it as well-established, others as needing further evidence to support it, and still others finding it indefensible.\nA 2020 meta-analysis of 25 studies examined the evidence that active memory suppression actually leads to decreased memory. It was found that in people with a repressive coping strategy, the willful avoidance of remembering certain memory contents leads to a significant reduction in memory performance for these contents. In addition, healthy people were better able to do this than anxious or depressed people. These results indicate that forgetting induced by suppression is a hallmark of mental wellbeing.\n\n\n## Repressed memories\n\n\nOne of the issues Freud struggled with was the status of the childhood \"memories\" recovered from repression in his therapy. He concluded that \"these scenes from infancy are not always true. Indeed, they are not true in the majority of cases, and in a few of them they are the direct opposite of the historical truth\". Controversy arose in the late 20th century about the status of such \"recovered memories\", particularly of child abuse, with many claiming that Freud had been wrong to ignore the reality of such recovered memories.\nWhile accepting \"the realities of child abuse\", the feminist Elaine Showalter considered it important that one \"distinguishes between abuse remembered all along, abuse spontaneously remembered, abuse recovered in therapy, and abuse suggested in therapy\". Memory researcher Elizabeth Loftus has shown that it is possible to implant false memories in individuals and that it is possible to \"come to doubt the validity of therapeutically recovered memories of sexual abuse ... [as] confabulations\". However, criminal prosecutors continue to present them as evidence in legal cases.\nThere is debate about the possibility of the repression of psychological trauma. While some evidence suggests that \"adults who have been through overwhelming trauma can suffer a psychic numbing, blocking out memory of or feeling about the catastrophe\", it appears that the trauma more often strengthens memories due to heightened emotional or physical sensations. (However these sensations may also cause distortions, as human memory in general is filtered both by layers of perception, and by \"appropriate mental schema ... spatio-temporal schemata\").\n\n\n## See also\n\nCensorship (psychoanalysis) \u2013 Barrier of the conscious and unconscious\nForeclosure (psychoanalysis) \u2013 Concept by the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan\nNarcissistic defence sequences \u2013 Mental processes which preserve the selfPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nThought suppression \u2013 Conscious effort to discontinue a thought\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n\n## References\n\nBoag, S.
