      "text": "# Hysterical_contagion\n\nIn social psychology, hysterical contagion occurs when people in a group show signs of a physical problem or illness, when in reality there are psychological and social forces at work.\nHysterical contagion is a strong form of social contagion; the symptoms can include those associated with clinical hysteria.\nIn 1977 Frieda L. Gehlen offered a revised theory of hysterical contagion that argues that what is actually contagious is the belief that showing certain characteristics will \"entitle one to the secondary benefits of the sick role.\" It may be an unconscious decision on the part of the individual. This approach posited by Gehlen is believed to be more consistent with the existing knowledge of the contagion process and the theoretical approaches to collective behavior.\n\n\n## June bug epidemic\n\nThe June bug epidemic serves as a classic example of hysterical contagion.  In 1962 a mysterious disease broke out in a dressmaking department of a US textile factory.  The symptoms included numbness, nausea, dizziness, and vomiting.  Word of a \"bug\" in the factory that would bite its victims and cause them to develop the above symptoms quickly spread.\nSoon sixty-two employees developed this mysterious illness, some of whom were hospitalized.  The news media reported on the case.  After research by company physicians and experts from the US Public Health Service Communicable Disease Center, it was concluded that the case was one of mass hysteria.\nWhile the researchers believed some workers may have in fact been bitten by an unspecified insect, anxiety was probably the cause of the symptoms.  No evidence was ever found for an insect or arachnid which could cause the above flu-like symptoms, nor did all workers demonstrate bites.\nWorkers concluded that the environment was quite stressful; the plant had recently opened, was quite busy and organization was poor. Further, most of the victims reported high levels of stress in their lives. Social forces seemed at work too.\nOf the 62 employees that reported symptoms, 59 worked on the first shift, 58 worked in the same area, and 50 of the 62 cases occurred in the two consecutive days after the media supposedly \u201csensationalized\u201d the event.  Most of the employees who became sick took time off to recuperate.\n\n\n## See also\n\n",

      "text": "# Iconic_memory\n\nIconic memory is the visual sensory memory register pertaining to the visual domain and a fast-decaying store of visual information. It is a component of the visual memory system which also includes visual short-term memory (VSTM) and long-term memory (LTM). Iconic memory is described as a very brief (<1 second), pre-categorical, high capacity memory store. It contributes to VSTM by providing a coherent representation of our entire visual perception for a very brief period of time. Iconic memory assists in accounting for phenomena such as change blindness and continuity of experience during saccades. Iconic memory is no longer thought of as a single entity but instead, is composed of at least two distinctive components.  Classic experiments including Sperling's partial report paradigm as well as modern techniques continue to provide insight into the nature of this SM store.\n\"Persistence of vision\" is the more general (and often outdated) notion of lingering visual impressions (potentially including afterimages and palinopsia), commonly associated with the reason why the interruptions between images in film and other stroboscopic media go unnoticed. \n\n\n## Overview\n\nThe occurrence of a sustained physiological image of an object after its physical offset has been observed by many individuals throughout history.  One of the earliest documented accounts of the phenomenon was by Aristotle who proposed  that afterimages were involved in the experience of a dream.  Natural observation of the light trail produced by glowing ember at the end of a quickly moving stick sparked the interest of researchers in the 1700s and 1800s.  They became the first to begin empirical studies on this phenomenon which later became known as visible persistence. In the 1900s, the role of visible persistence in memory gained considerable attention due to its hypothesized role as a pre-categorical representation of visual information in visual short-term memory (VSTM). In 1960, George Sperling began his classic partial-report experiments to confirm the existence of visual sensory memory and some of its characteristics including capacity and duration. It was not until 1967 that Ulric Neisser termed this quickly decaying memory store iconic memory. Approximately 20 years after Sperling's original experiments, two separate components of visual sensory memory began to emerge: visual persistence and informational persistence.  Sperling's experiments mainly tested the information pertaining to a stimulus, whereas others such as Coltheart performed directs tests of visual persistence.  In 1978, Di Lollo proposed a two-state model of visual sensory memory. Although it has been debated throughout history, current understanding of iconic memory makes a clear distinction between visual and informational persistence which are tested differently and have fundamentally different properties. Informational persistence which is the basis behind iconic memory is thought to be the key contributor to visual short-term memory as the precategorical sensory store.\nA similar storage area serves as a temporary warehouse for sounds.\n\n\n## Components\n\nThe two main components of iconic memory are visible persistence and informational persistence.  The first is a relatively brief (150 ms) pre-categorical visual representation of the physical image created by the sensory system.  This would be the \"snapshot\" of what the individual is looking at and perceiving. The second component is a longer-lasting memory store which represents a coded version of the visual image into post-categorical information. This would be the \"raw data\" that is taken in and processed by the brain. A third component may also be considered which is neural persistence: the physical activity and recordings of the visual system. Neural persistence is generally represented by neuroscientific techniques such as EEG and fMRI.\n\n\n### Visible persistence\nVisible persistence is the phenomenal impression that a visual image remains present after its physical offset.  This can be considered a by-product of neural persistence. Visible persistence is more sensitive to the physical parameters of the stimulus than informational persistence which is reflected in its two key properties.: \n\nThe duration of visible persistence is inversely related to stimulus duration.  This means that the longer the physical stimulus is presented for, the faster the visual image decays in memory.\nThe duration of visible persistence is inversely related to stimulus luminance. When the luminance, or brightness of a stimulus is increased, the duration of visible persistence decreases. Due to the involvement of the neural system, visible persistence is highly dependent on the physiology of the photoreceptors and activation of different cell types in the visual cortex.  This visible representation is subject to masking effects whereby the presentation of interfering stimulus during, or immediately after stimulus offset interferes with one's ability to remember the stimulus.\nDifferent techniques have been used to attempt to identify the duration of visible persistence.  The Duration of Stimulus Technique is one in which a probe stimulus (auditory \"click\") is presented simultaneously with the onset, and on a separate trial, with the offset of a visual display. The difference represents the duration of the visible store which was found to be approximately 100-200 ms. Alternatively, the Phenomenal Continuity and Moving Slit Technique estimated visible persistence to be 300 ms. In the first paradigm, an image is presented discontinuously with blank periods in between presentations.  If the duration is short enough, the participant will perceive a continuous image.  Similarly, the Moving Slit Technique is also based on the participant observing a continuous image.  Only instead of flashing the entire stimulus on and off, only a very narrow portion or \"slit\" of the image is displayed.  When the slit is oscillated at the correct speed, a complete image is viewed.\n\n\n=### Neural basis=\nUnderlying visible persistence is neural persistence of the visual sensory pathway. A prolonged visual representation begins with activation of photoreceptors in the retina.  Although activation in both rods and cones has been found to persist beyond the physical offset of a stimulus, the rod system persists longer than cones. Other cells involved in a sustained visible image include M and P retinal ganglion cells. M cells (transient cells), are active only during stimulus onset and stimulus offset.  P cells (sustained cells), show continuous activity during stimulus onset, duration, and offset. Cortical persistence of the visual image has been found in the primary visual cortex (V1) in the occipital lobe which is responsible for processing visual information.\n\n\n### Informational persistence\nInformation persistence represents the information about a stimulus that persists after its physical offset. It is visual in nature, but not visible. Sperling's experiments were a test of informational persistence. Stimulus duration is the key contributing factor to the duration of informational persistence.  As stimulus duration increases, so does the duration of the visual code. The non-visual components represented by informational persistence include the abstract characteristics of the image, as well as its spatial location. Due to the nature of informational persistence, unlike visible persistence, it is immune to masking effects.  The characteristics of this component of iconic memory suggest that it plays the key role in representing a post-categorical memory store for which VSTM can access information for consolidation. \n\n\n=### Neural basis=\nAlthough less research exists regarding the neural representation of informational persistence compared to visible persistence, new electrophysiological techniques have begun to reveal cortical areas involved. Unlike visible persistence, informational persistence is thought to rely on higher-level visual areas beyond the visual cortex.  The anterior superior temporal sulcus (STS), a part of the ventral stream, was found to be active in macaques during iconic memory tasks. This brain region is associated with object recognition and object identity. Iconic memory's role in change detection has been related to activation in the middle occipital gyrus (MOG).  MOG activation was found to persist for approximately 2000ms suggesting a possibility that iconic memory has a longer duration than what was currently thought. Iconic memory is also influenced by genetics and proteins produced in the brain. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a part of the neurotrophin family of nerve growth factors.  Individuals with mutations to the BDNF gene which codes for BDNF have been shown to have shortened, less stable informational persistence.\n\n\n## Role\n\nIconic memory provides a smooth stream of visual information to the brain which can be extracted over an extended period of time by VSTM for consolidation into more stable forms. One of iconic memory's key roles is involved with change detection of our visual environment which assists in the perception of motion.\n\n\n### Temporal integration\nIconic memory enables integrating visual information along a continuous stream of images, for example when watching a movie. In the primary visual cortex new stimuli do not erase information about previous stimuli. Instead the responses to the most recent stimulus contain about equal amounts of information about both this and the preceding stimulus. This one-back memory may be the main substrate for both the integration processes in iconic memory and masking effects. The particular outcome depends on whether the two subsequent component images (i.e., the \"icons\") are meaningful only when isolated (masking) or only when superimposed (integration).\n\n\n### Change blindness\nThe brief representation in iconic memory is thought to play a key role in the ability to detect change in a visual scene. The phenomenon of change blindness has provided insight into the nature of the iconic memory store and its role in vision. Change blindness refers to an inability to detect differences in two successive scenes separated by a very brief blank interval, or interstimulus interval (ISI). As such change blindness can be defined as being a slight lapse in iconic memory. When scenes are presented without an ISI, the change is easily detectable.  It is thought that the detailed memory store of the scene in iconic memory is erased by each ISI, which renders the memory inaccessible. This reduces the ability to make comparisons between successive scenes.\n\n\n### Saccadic eye movement\nIt has been suggested that iconic memory plays a role in providing continuity of experience during saccadic eye movements. These rapid eye movements occur in approximately 30 ms and each fixation lasts for approximately 300 ms.  Research suggests however, that memory for information between saccades is largely dependent on VSTM and not iconic memory. Instead of contributing to trans-saccadic memory, information stored in iconic memory is thought to actually be erased during saccades.  A similar phenomenon occurs during eye-blinks whereby both automatic and intentional blinking disrupts the information stored in iconic memory.\n\n\n## Development\n\nThe development of  iconic memory begins at birth and continues as development of the primary and secondary visual system occurs. By 6 months of age, infants' iconic memory capacity approaches adults'. By 5 years of age, children have developed the same unlimited capacity of iconic memory that adults possess. The duration of informational persistence however increases from approximately 200 ms at age 5, to an asymptotic level of 1000 ms as an adult (>11 years). A small decrease in visual persistence occurs with age. A decrease of approximately 20 ms has been observed when comparing individuals in their early 20s to those in their late 60s. Throughout one's lifetime, mild cognitive impairments (MCIs) may develop such as errors in episodic memory (autobiographical memory about people, places, and their contex), and working memory (the active processing component of STM) due to damage in hippocampal and association cortical areas.  Episodic memories are autobiographical events that a person can discuss.   Individuals with MCIs have been found to show decreased iconic memory capacity and duration.  Iconic memory impairment in those with MCIs may be used as a predictor for the development of more severe deficits such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia later in life. Previous studies have shown that glucocorticoids have been closely linked to impact higher cognitive functioning. Glucocorticoid exposure causes severe memory retrieval impairment, explicitly advancing iconic memory decay. It reduces the active maintenance and storage of sensory information by altering transient neural responses during the initial stimulus processing stages.  Elevated cortisol levels have also been associated with faster iconic memory decay and top-down processing impairment, putting individuals at a higher risk of developing Dementia and AD.  \nIconic memory formation has been previously described as attention-free and fleeting, however newer studies have shown that in fact it does require attention. IM is shown to decay at a faster rate if attention focus is not appropriately met to the attention load. This allows for the information that is being transported into working memory to be retained more precisely.  Iconic memory decay has been found to occur at a rapid speed after the visual stimulus is no longer present. Without active retrieval, iconic memory averages to disappear within half a second. The theory of gradual decay in visual working memory claims that the accuracy at which the stimulus is remembered in iconic memory deteriorates over time. However, information stored in sensory memory is considered to facilitate exponential decay. \n\n\n## Sperling's partial report procedure\n\nIn 1960, George Sperling became the first to use a partial report paradigm to investigate the bipartite model of VSTM.  In Sperling's initial experiments in 1960, observers were presented with a tachistoscopic visual stimulus for a brief  period of time (50 ms) consisting of either a 3x3 or 3x4 array of alphanumeric characters such as: \n\nP Y F G\nV J S A\nD H B U\nRecall was based on a cue which followed the offset of the stimulus and directed the subject to recall a specific line of letters from the initial display. Memory performance was compared under two conditions: whole report and partial report.\n\n\n### Whole report\n\nThe whole report condition required participants to recall as many elements from the original display in their proper spatial locations as possible. Participants were typically able to recall three to five characters from the twelve character display (~35%). This suggests that whole report is limited by a memory system with a capacity of four-to-five items.\n\n\n### Partial report\nThe partial report condition required participants to identify a subset of the characters from the visual display using cued recall. The cue was a tone which sounded at various time intervals (~50 ms) following the offset of the stimulus. The frequency of the tone (high, medium, or low) indicated which set of characters within the display were to be reported. Due to the fact that participants did not know which row would be cued for recall, performance in the partial report condition can be regarded as a random sample of an observer's memory for the entire display. This type of sampling revealed that immediately after stimulus offset, participants could recall a given row (from a 3x3 grid of 9 letters) on 75% of trials, suggesting that 75% of the entire visual display (75% of 9-letters) was accessible to memory.  This is a dramatic increase in the hypothesized capacity of iconic memory derived from full-report trials.\n\n\n## Variations of the partial report procedure\n\n\n\n### Visual bar cue\nA small variation in Sperling's partial report procedure which yielded similar results was the use of a visual bar marker instead of an auditory tone as the retrieval cue. In this modification, participants were presented with a visual display of 2 rows of 8 letters for 50 ms.  The probe was a visual bar placed above or below a letter's position simultaneously with array offset.  Participants had an average accuracy of 65% when asked to recall the designated letter.\n\n\n### Temporal variations\nVarying the time between the offset of the display and the auditory cue allowed Sperling to estimate the time course of sensory memory. Sperling deviated from the original procedure by varying tone presentation from immediately after stimulus offset, to 150, 500, or 1000 ms. Using this technique, the initial memory for a stimulus display was found to decay rapidly after display offset. At approximately 1000 ms after stimulus offset, there was no difference in recall between the partial-report and whole report conditions. Overall, experiments using partial report provided evidence for a rapidly decaying sensory trace lasting approximately 1000 ms after the offset of a display\n\n\n=### Circle cue and masking=\nThe effects of masking were identified by the use of a circle presented around a letter as the cue for recall. When the circle was presented before the visual stimulus onset or simultaneously with stimulus offset, recall matched that found when using a bar or tone.  However, if a circle was used as a cue 100 ms after stimulus offset, there was decreased accuracy in recall.  As the delay of circle presentation increased, accuracy once again improved.  This phenomenon was an example of metacontrast masking.  Masking was also observed when images such as random lines were presented immediately after stimulus offset.\n\n\n## See also\n\n",

      "text": "# Idealism\n\nIdealism in philosophy, also known as philosophical idealism or metaphysical idealism, is the set of metaphysical perspectives asserting that, most fundamentally, reality is equivalent to mind, spirit, or consciousness; that reality or truth is entirely a mental construct; or that ideas are the highest type of reality or have the greatest claim to being considered \"real\". Because there are different types of idealism, it is difficult to define the term uniformly.\nIndian philosophy contains some of the first defenses of idealism, such as in Vedanta and in Shaiva Pratyabhij\u00f1a thought. These systems of thought argue for an all-pervading consciousness as the true nature and ground of reality. Idealism is also found in some streams of Mahayana Buddhism, such as in the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school, which argued for a \"mind-only\" (cittamatra) philosophy on an analysis of subjective experience. In the West, idealism traces its roots back to Plato in ancient Greece, who proposed that absolute, unchanging, timeless ideas constitute the highest form of reality: Platonic idealism. This was revived and transformed in the early modern period by Immanuel Kant's arguments that our knowledge of reality is completely based on mental structures: transcendental idealism.\nEpistemologically, idealism is accompanied by a rejection of the possibility of knowing the existence of any thing independent of mind. Ontologically, idealism asserts that the existence of all things depends upon the mind; thus, ontological idealism rejects the perspectives of physicalism and dualism. In contrast to materialism, idealism asserts the primacy of consciousness as the origin and prerequisite of all phenomena.\nIdealism came under attack from proponents of analytical philosphy, such as G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell, but its critics also included the new realists and Marxists. However, many aspects and paradigms of idealism still have a large influence on subsequent philosophy.\n\n\n## Definitions\n\nIdealism is a term with several related meanings. It comes via Latin idea from the Ancient Greek idea (\u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1) from idein (\u1f30\u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd), meaning \"to see\". The term entered the English language by 1743. The term idealism was first used in the abstract metaphysical sense of the \"belief that reality is made up only of ideas\" by Christian Wolff in 1747. The term re-entered the English language in this abstract sense by 1796. A. C. Ewing gives this influential definition:\n\nthe view that there can be no physical objects existing apart from some experience...provided that we regard thinking as part of experience and do not imply by \"experience\" passivity, and provided we include under experience not only human experience but the so-called \"Absolute Experience\" or the experience of a God such as Berkeley postulates.\nA more recent definition by Willem deVries sees idealism as \"roughly, the genus comprises theories that attribute ontological priority to the mental, especially the conceptual or ideational, over the non-mental.\" As such, idealism entails a rejection of materialism (or physicalism) as well as the rejection of the mind-independent existence of matter (and as such, also entails a rejection of dualism).\nThere are two main metaphysical concepts on the position of idealism in contemporary philosophy, depending on whether its thesis is ontological or epistemic:\n\nOntological idealism is the view which holds that all of reality is in some way mental (or spirit, reason, or will) or at least ultimately grounded in a fundamental basis which is mental. This is a form of metaphysical monism because it holds that there is only one type of thing in existence. The modern paradigm of a Western metaphysical idealism is Berkeley's immaterialism. Other such idealists are Hegel, and Bradley.\nEpistemological idealism (or \"formal\" idealism) is a position in epistemology that holds that all knowledge is based on mental structures, not on \"things in themselves\". Whether a mind-independent reality is accepted or not, all that we have knowledge of are mental phenomena. The main source of Western epistemic idealist arguments is the transcendental idealism of Kant. Other thinkers who have defended epistemic idealist arguments include Ludwig Boltzmann and Brand Blanshard.\nThus, ontological idealism holds that reality itself is non-physical, immaterial, or experiential at its core, while epistemological idealist arguments merely affirm that reality can only be known through ideas and mental structures (without necessarily making metaphysical claims about things in themselves). Because of this, A.C. Ewing argued that instead of thinking about these two categories as forms of idealism proper, we should instead speak of epistemic and ontological arguments for idealism.\nThese two ways of arguing for idealism are sometimes combined to defend a specific type of idealism (as done by Berkeley), but they may also be defended as independent theses by different thinkers. For example, while F. H. Bradley and McTaggart focused on metaphysical arguments, Josiah Royce, and Brand Blanshard developed epistemological arguments.\nFurthermore, one might use epistemic arguments, but remain neutral about the metaphysical nature of things in themselves. This metaphysically neutral position, which is not a form of metaphysical idealism proper, may be associated with figures like Rudolf Carnap, Quine, Donald Davidson, and perhaps even Kant himself (though he is difficult to categorize). The most famous kind of epistemic idealism is associated with Kantianism and transcendental idealism, as well as with the related Neo-Kantian philosophies. Transcendental idealists like Kant affirm epistemic idealistic arguments without committing themselves to whether reality as such, the \"thing in itself\", is ultimately mental.\n\n\n### Types of ontological idealism\nWithin ontological idealism, there are numerous further sub-types, including forms of pluralism, which hold that there are many independent mental substances or minds, such as Leibniz' monadology, and various forms of monism or absolute idealism (e.g. Hegelianism or Advaita Vedanta), which hold that the fundamental mental reality is a single unity or is grounded in some kind of singular Absolute. Beyond this, idealists disagree on which aspects of the mental are more metaphysically basic. Platonic idealism affirms that ideal forms are more basic to reality than the things we perceive, while subjective idealists and phenomenalists privilege sensory experiences. Personalism, meanwhile, sees persons or selves as fundamental.\nA common distinction is between subjective and objective forms of idealism. Subjective idealists like George Berkeley reject the existence of a mind-independent or \"external\" world (though not the appearance of such phenomena in the mind). However, not all idealists restrict the real to subjective experience. Objective idealists make claims about a trans-empirical world, but simply deny that this world is essentially divorced from or ontologically prior to mind or consciousness as such. Thus, objective idealism asserts that the reality of experiencing includes and transcends the realities of the object experienced and of the mind of the observer.\nIdealism is sometimes categorized as a type of metaphysical anti-realism or skepticism. However, idealists need not reject the existence of an objective reality that we can obtain knowledge of, and can merely affirm that this real natural world is mental. Thus, David Chalmers writes of anti-realist idealisms (which would include Berkeley's) and realist forms of idealism, such as \"panpsychist versions of idealism where fundamental microphysical entities are conscious subjects, and on which matter is realized by these conscious subjects and their relations.\"\n\nChalmers further outlines the following taxonomy of idealism:Micro-idealism is the thesis that concrete reality is wholly grounded in micro-level mentality: that is, in mentality associated with fundamental microscopic entities (such as quarks and photons). Macro-idealism is the thesis that concrete reality is wholly grounded in macro-level mentality: that is, in mentality associated with macroscopic (middle-sized) entities such as humans and perhaps non-human animals. Cosmic idealism is the thesis that concrete reality is wholly grounded in cosmic mentality: that is, in mentality associated with the cosmos as a whole or with a single cosmic entity (such as the universe or a deity). Guyer et al. also distinguish between forms of idealism which are grounded in substance theory (often found in the Anglophone idealisms of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries) and forms of idealism which focus on activities or dynamic processes (favored in post-Kantian German philosophy).\n\n\n## Classical Greek idealism\n\n\n\n### Pre-Socratic philosophy\nThere are some precursors of idealism in Ancient Greek Philosophy, though scholars disagree on whether any of these thinkers could be properly labeled \"idealist\" in the modern sense.\nOne example is Anaxagoras (480 BC) who taught that all things in the universe (apeiron) were set in motion by nous (\"mind\"). In the Phaedo, Plato quotes him as saying, \"it is intelligence [nous] that arranges and causes all things\". Similarly, Parmenides famously stated that \"thinking and being are the same\". This has led some scholars, such as Hegel and E. D. Phillips, to label Parmenides an idealist.\n\n\n### Platonism and neoplatonism\n\nPlato's theory of forms or \"ideas\" (eidos) as described in dialogues like Phaedo, Parmenides and Sophist, describes ideal forms (for example the platonic solids in geometry or abstracts like Goodness and Justice), as perfect beings which \"exists-by-itself\" (Greek: auto kath' auto), that is, independently of any particular instance (whether physical or in the individual thought of any person). Anything that exists in the world exists by participating in one of these unique ideas, which are nevertheless interrelated causally with the world of becoming, with nature. Arne Gr\u00f8n calls this doctrine \"the classic example of a metaphysical idealism as a transcendent idealism\". Nevertheless, Plato holds that matter as perceived by us is real, though transitory, imperfect, and dependent on the eternal ideas for its existence. Because of this, some scholars have seen Plato as a dualist, though others disagree and favor a monist account.\nThe thought of Plato was widely influential, and later Late Platonist (or Neoplatonist) thinkers developed Platonism in new directions. Plotinus, the most influential of the later Platonists, wrote \"Being and Intellect are therefore one nature\" (Enneads V.9.8). According to scholars like Nathaniel Alfred Boll and Ludwig Noir\u00e9, with Plotinus, a true idealism which holds that only soul or mind exists appears for the first time in Western philosophy. Similarly, for Maria Luisa Gatti, Plotinus' philosophy is a \"'contemplationist metaphysics', in which contemplation, as creative, constitutes the reason for the being of everything\". For Neoplatonist thinkers, the first cause or principle is the Idea of the Good, i.e. The One, from which everything is derived a hierarchical procession (proodos) (Enn. VI.7.15).\n\n\n## Idealism in Judaism and Christianity\n\nSome Christian theologians have held idealist views, often based on neoplatonism. Christian neoplatonism included figures like Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, and influenced numerous Christian thinkers, including the Cappadocian Fathers and Augustine. Despite the influence of Aristotelian scholasticism from the 12th century onward, there is certainly a sense in which some medieval scholastic philosophers retained influences from the Platonic idealism that came via Augustine. For example, the work of John Scotus Eriugena (c. 800 \u2013 c. 877) has been interpreted as an idealistic philosophy by Dermot Moran who writes that for Scotus \"all spatiotemporal reality is understood as immaterial, mind dependent, and lacking in independent existence\". Scotus thus wrote: \"the intellection of all things...is the being of all things\".\nIdealism was also defended in medieval Jewish philosophy. According to Samuel Lebens, early Hassidic rabbis like Yitzchak Luria (1534\u201372) defended a form of Kabbalistic idealism in which the world was God's dream or a fictional tale told by God.\nLater Western theistic idealism such as that of Hermann Lotze offers a theory of the \"world ground\" in which all things find their unity: it has been widely accepted by Protestant theologians.\nSeveral modern religious movements such as, for example, the organizations within the New Thought Movement and the Unity Church, may be said to have a particularly idealist orientation. The theology of Christian Science includes a form of idealism: it teaches that all that truly exists is God and God's ideas; that the world as it appears to the senses is a distortion of the underlying spiritual reality, a distortion that may be corrected (both conceptually and in terms of human experience) through a reorientation (spiritualization) of thought.\n\n\n## Idealism in Eastern philosophy\n\n\nThere are currents of idealism throughout Indian philosophy, ancient and modern. Some forms of Hindu idealism (like Advaita) defend a type of monism or non-dualism, in which a single consciousness (brahman) is all that exists. However, other traditions defend a theistic pluralism (e.g. Shaiva Siddhanta), in which there are many selves (atman) and one God.\nBuddhist idealism on the other hand is non-theistic and does not accept the existence of eternal selves (due to their adherence to the theory of not-self).\n\n\n### Hindu philosophy\n\nA type of idealistic monism can be seen in the Upanishads, which often describe the ultimate reality of brahman as \"being, consciousness, bliss\" (Saccid\u0101nanda). The Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad teaches that everything is an emanation of the immortal brahman, which is the essence and source of all things, and is identical with the self (atman). The B\u1e5bhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad also describes brahman as awaress and bliss, and states that \"this great being (mahad bh\u016btam) without an end, boundless (ap\u0101ra), [is] nothing but vij\u00f1\u0101na [consciousness].\"\nIdealist notions can be found in different schools of Hindu philosophy, including some schools of Vedanta. Other schools like the Samkhya and Nyaya-Vaisheshika, Mimamsa, Yoga, Vishishtadvaita, Dvaita, and others opposed idealism in favor of realism.\nDifferent schools of Vedanta have different interpretations of brahman-atman, their foundational theory. Advaita Vedanta posits an absolute idealistic monism in which reality is one single absolute existence. Thus, brahman (the ultimate ground of all) is absolutely identical with all atmans (individual selves). Other forms of Vedanta like the Vishishtadvaita of Ramanuja and the Bhedabheda of Bh\u0101skara are not as radical in their non-dualism, accepting that there is a certain difference between individual souls and Brahman.\n\n\n=### Advaita=\n\nThe most influential Advaita philosopher was \u0100di \u015aa\u1e45kara (788\u2013820). In his philosophy, brahman is the single non-dual foundation (adhi\u1e63\u1e6dhana) for all existence. This reality is independent, self-established, irreducible, immutable, and free of space, time, and causation. In comparison to this reality, the world of plurality and appearances is illusory (maya), an unreal cognitive error (mithya). This includes all individual souls or selves, which are actually unreal and numerically identical to the one brahman.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara did not believe it was possible to prove the view that reality is \"one only, without a second\" (Chandogya 6.2.1) through independent philosophical reasoning. Instead, he accepts non-duality based on the authority of the Upani\u1e63ads. As such, most of his extant works are scriptural commentaries.\nNevertheless, he did provide various new arguments to defend his theories. A major metaphysical distinction for \u015aa\u1e45kara is between what changes and may thus be negated (the unreal) and what does not (which is what is truly real). He compares the real to clay (the substantial cause, analogous to brahman) and the unreal to a pot which depends on the clay for its being (analogous to all impermanent things in the universe). By relying on dependence relations and on the reality of persistence, \u015aa\u1e45kara concludes that metaphysical foundations are more real than their impermanent effects, and that effects are fully reducible and indeed identical to their metaphysical foundation. Through this argument from dependence, \u015aa\u1e45kara concludes that since all things in the universe undergoes change, they must depend on some really existent cause for their being, and this is the one primordial undifferentiated existence (Chandogya Bh\u0101\u1e63ya, 6.2.1\u20132). This one reality is the single cause that is in every object, and every thing is not different from this brahman since all things borrow their existence from it. \u015aa\u1e45kara also provides a cosmogony in which the world arises from an unmanifest state which is like deep dreamless sleep into a state in which \u012b\u015bvara (God) dreams the world into existence. As such, the world is not separate from God's mind.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara's philosophy, along with that of his contemporary Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra (c. 8th century CE), is at the foundation of Advaita school. The opponents of this school however, labeled him a m\u0101y\u0101v\u0101din (illusionist) for negating the reality of the world. They also criticized what they saw as a problematic explanation for how the world arises from m\u0101y\u0101 as an error. For them, if m\u0101y\u0101 is in brahman, then brahman has ignorance, but if it is not in brahman, then this collapses into a dualism of brahman and m\u0101y\u0101.\n\n\n=### Other idealist schools=\nPerhaps the most influential critic of Advaita was R\u0101m\u0101nuja (c. 1017 \u2013 c. 1137), the main philosopher of the competing Vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dvaita (qualified non-dual) school. His philosophy affirms the reality of the world and individual selves as well as affirming an underlying unity of all things with God. One of R\u0101m\u0101nuja's critiques of advaita is epistemological. If, as Advaita argues, all cognition other than pure undifferentiated consciousness is based in error, then it follows we would have no knowledge of the very fact that all individual cognition is error (\u015ar\u012b Bh\u0101\u1e63ya, I.i.1).\nFurthermore, R\u0101m\u0101nuja also argues contra Advaita that individual selves are real and not illusory. This is because the very idea that an individual can be ignorant presupposes the very existence of that individual. Furthermore, since all Ved\u0101ntins agree that Brahman's nature is knowledge, consciousness and being, to say that brahman is ignorant is absurd, and so it must be individual souls which are ignorant. Thus, there must be individual selves with a metaphysically prior existence who then fall into ignorance (\u015ar\u012b Bh\u0101\u1e63ya, I.i.1.). Selves might be individual, but as the Vedas state, they still share a sense of unity with brahman. For R\u0101m\u0101nuja, this is because selves are distinct modes or qualities in the cosmic body of Brahman (and are thus different and yet united with brahman). Brahman meanwhile is like the soul in the body of the world. Furthermore, brahman is a theistic creator God for R\u0101m\u0101nuja, which really exists as the union of two deities: Vishnu, and Lak\u1e63m\u012b.\nThe philosophy of the Tantric tradition of Trika Shaivism is a non-dual theistic idealism. The key thinkers of this philosophical tradition, known as the Pratyabhij\u00f1\u0101 (Recognition) school, are the Kashmirian philosophers Utpaladeva (c. 900\u2013950 CE) and Abhinavagupta (975\u20131025 CE). This tradition affirms a non-dual monism which sees God (Shiva) as a single cosmic consciousness. All selves (atman) are one with God, but they have forgotten this, and must recognize their true nature in order to reach liberation.\nUnlike in Advaita Vedanta however, the one cosmic consciousness is active and dynamic, consisting of spontaneous vibration (spanda) since it has the quality of absolute freedom (sv\u0101t\u0101ntrya). Through the power (\u015aakti) of dynamic vibrations, the absolute (Shiva-\u015aakti, consciousness and its power) creates the world, and so, the world is a real manifestation of absolute consciousness. Thus, in this system, the world and individual selves (which are dynamic, not an unchanging witness) are not an unreal illusion, but are seen as real and active expressions of God's creative freedom.\nIdealism has remained influential in modern Hindu philosophy, especially in Neo-Vedanta modernism. Prominent modern defenders include Ram Mohan Roy (1772\u20131833), Vivekananda (1863\u20131902), Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (An Idealist View of Life, 1932) and Aurobindo (1872\u20131950).\n\n\n### Buddhist philosophy\nBuddhist views reminiscent of idealism appear in Mahayana scriptures like the Explanation of the Profound Secrets, Descent into La\u1e45ka, and Ten Stages Sutra. These theories, known as \"mind-only\" (cittamatra) or \"the consciousness doctrine\" (vij\u00f1anavada) were mostly associated with the Indian Buddhist philosophers of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school and the related epistemological school (Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da). These figures include: Vasubandhu, Asa\u1e45ga, Dign\u0101ga, Dharmak\u012brti, Sthiramati, Dharmap\u0101la, J\u00f1\u0101na\u015br\u012bmitra, \u015aa\u1e45karanandana, and Ratn\u0101kara\u015b\u0101nti. Their arguments were a lively subject of debate for Buddhist and non-Buddhist philosophers in India for centuries. These discussions had a lasting influence on the later Buddhist philosophy of East Asian Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism.\nThere is some modern scholarly disagreement about whether Indian Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Buddhism can be said to be a form of idealism. Some writers like philosopher Jay Garfield and German philologist Lambert Schmithausen argue that Indian Yogacarins are metaphysical idealists that reject the existence of a mind independent external world. Others see them as closer to an epistemic idealist like Kant who holds that our knowledge of the world is simply knowledge of our own concepts and perceptions. However, a major difference here is that while Kant holds that the thing-in-itself is unknowable, Indian Yogacarins held that ultimate reality is knowable, but only through the non-conceptual yogic perception of a highly trained meditative mind. Other scholars like Dan Lusthaus and Thomas Kochumuttom see Yog\u0101c\u0101ra as a kind of phenomenology of experience which seeks to understand how suffering (dukkha) arises in the mind, not provide a metaphysics.\n\n\n=### Vasubandhu=\n\nWhatever the case, the works of Vasubandhu (fl. c.360) certainly include a refutation of mind-independent \"external\" objects (Sanskrit: b\u0101hy\u0101rtha) and argue that the true nature of reality is beyond subject-object distinctions. He views ordinary conscious experience as deluded in its perceptions of an external world separate from itself (which does not exist), and instead argues that all there is vij\u00f1apti (ideas, mental images, conscious appearances, representations). Vasubandhu begins his Twenty verses (Vi\u1e43\u015bik\u0101) by affirming that \"all this [everything we take to exist] is mere appearance of consciousness [vij\u00f1apti], because of the appearance of non-existent objects, just as a man with an eye disease sees non-existent hairs\" (Vi\u1e43\u015b.1). His main argument against external objects is a critique of the atomist theories of his realist opponents (Ny\u0101ya and Abhidharma theorists).\nVasubandhu also responds against three objections to idealism which indicate his view that all appearances are caused by mind: (1) the issue of spatio-temporal continuity, (2) accounting for intersubjectivity, and (3) the causal efficacy of matter on subjects. For the first and third objections, Vasubandhu responds by arguing that dreams can also include spatio-temporal continuity, regularity and causal efficacy. Regarding intersubjectivity, Vasubandhu appeals to shared karma as well as mind to mind causation. After answering these objections, Vasubandhu argues that idealism is a better explanation than realism for everyday experiences. To do this, he relies on the Indian \"Principle of Lightness\" (an appeal to parsimony like Occam's Razor) and argues that idealism is the \"lighter\" theory since it posits a smaller number of entities. This is thus an argument from simplicity and an inference to the best explanation (i.e. an abductive argument).\nAs such, he affirms that our usual experience of being a self (\u0101tman) that knows objects is an illusory construct, and this constitutes what he calls the \"imagined nature\" aspect of reality.\nThus, for Vasubandhu, there is a more fundamental \"root consciousness\" that is empty of subject-object distinctions and yet originates all experiences \"just as waves originate on water\" (Thirty Verses, Tri\u1e43\u015b.17). However, Vasubandhu sees this philosophy as a mere conventional description, since ultimate reality is \"inconceivable\" (Tri\u1e43\u015b.29), an ineffable and non-conceptual \"thusness\" which cannot be fully captured in words and can only be known through meditative realization by yogis (\"yogacaras\", hence the name of his school). This is why certain modern interpreters, like Jonathan Gold, see Vasubandhu's thought as a \"conventionalist idealism\" or even a type of epistemic idealism like Kant's (and not a full blown objective idealism).\n\n\n=### The Buddhist epistemologists=\nBuddhist arguments against external objects were further expanded and sharpened by later figures like Dign\u0101ga (fl. 6th century) and Dharmak\u012brti (fl. 7th century) who led an epistemological turn in medieval Indian philosophy.\nDign\u0101ga's main arguments against external objects (specifically, atomic particles) are found in his \u0100lambanapar\u012bk\u1e63\u0101 (Examination of the Object of Consciousness). Dign\u0101ga argues that for something to be an object (\u0101lambana) of a conscious state, that object must be causally related to the consciousness and it must resemble that consciousness (in appearance or content). Dign\u0101ga then attempts to show that realism about external particulars cannot satisfy these two conditions. Since individual atoms lack a resemblance to the conscious state they supposedly cause, they cannot be the object of cognition. Furthermore, aggregates of atoms also cannot be the object, since they are merely a conceptual grouping of individual atoms (and thus, unreal), and only atoms have causal efficacy.\nDharmak\u012brti's view is summed up in the Pram\u0101na\u1e7f\u0101rttika (Commentary on Epistemology) as follows: \"cognition experiences itself, and nothing else whatsoever. Even the particular objects of perception, are by nature just consciousness itself.\" One of his main arguments for idealism is the inference from \"the necessity of things only ever being experienced together with experience\" (Sanskrit: sahopalambhaniyama). Dharmak\u012brti consicely states this argument in the Ascertainment of Epistemology (Pram\u0101\u1e47avini\u015bcaya): \"blue and the consciousness of blue are not different, because they must always be apprehended together.\" Since an object is never found independently of consciousness, objects cannot be mind-independent. This can be read as an epistemological argument for idealism which attempts to show there is no good reason (empirically or inferentially) to accept the existence of external objects.\nMost of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra thinkers and epistemologists (including Dharmak\u012brti) defended the existence of multiple mindstreams, and even tackled the problem of other minds. As such, thinkers like Dharmak\u012brti were pluralists who held there were multiple minds in the world (in this they differ with Hindu Advaita thinkers who held there was a single cosmic consciousness). However, there was a certain sub-school of Indian Buddhists, exemplified by Praj\u00f1akaragupta, J\u00f1\u0101na\u015br\u012bmitra (fl. 975\u20131025 C.E.) and Ratnak\u012brti (11th century CE) who were not pluralists. In his Refutation of Other mindstreams (Sant\u0101n\u0101ntarad\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a), Ratnak\u012brti argues that the existence of other minds cannot be established ultimately, and as such ultimate reality must be an undifferentiated non-dual consciousness (vij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101dvaita). This monistic interpretation of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra is known as the Citr\u0101dvaitav\u0101da school (the view of variegated non-duality) since it sees reality as a single multifaceted non-dual luminosity (citr\u0101dvaitaprak\u0101\u015ba).\n\n\n### Chinese philosophy\n\nIn Chinese philosophy, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra idealism was defended by Chinese Buddhists like Xuanzang (602\u2013664) and his students Kuiji (632\u2013682) and W\u014fnch'\u016dk (613\u2013696). Xuanzang had studied Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Buddhism at the great Indian university of Nalanda under the Indian philosopher \u015a\u012blabhadra. His work, especially The Demonstration of Consciousness-only, was pivotal in the establishment of East Asian Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Buddhism (also known as \"consciousness only\", Ch: Weishi \u552f\u8b58), which in turn influenced East Asian Buddhist thought in general.\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra Buddhism also influenced the thought of other Chinese Buddhist philosophical traditions, such as Huayan, Tiantai, Pure Land, and Zen. Many Chinese Buddhist traditions like Huayan, Zen, and Tiantai were also strongly influenced by an important text called the Awakening of Faith in the Mah\u0101y\u0101na, which synthesized consciousness-only idealism with buddha-nature thought. This text promoted an influential theory of mind which holds that all phenomena are manifestations of the \"One Mind\". Some scholars have seen this as an ontological monism. One passage from the text states: \"the three worlds are illusory constructs, created by the mind alone\" and \"all dharmas are produced from the mind's giving rise to false thoughts\". Jorgensen et al. note that this indicates metaphysical idealism. The new philosophical trend ushered in by the Awakening of Faith was resisted by some Chinese Yog\u0101c\u0101ra thinkers, and the debates between the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school of Xuanzang and those who instead followed the doctrines of the Awakening of Faith continued until the modern era. These debates happened in China as well as in Japan and Korea.\nThe doctrine that all phenomena arise from an ultimate principle, the One Mind, was adapted by the influential Huayan school, whose thought is exemplified by thinkers such as Fazang (643\u2013712) and Zongmi (780\u2013841). This tradition also promoted a kind of holism which sees every phenomenon in the cosmos as interfused and interconnected with every other phenomenon. Chinese scholars like Yu-lan Fung and Wing-tsit Chan see Huayan philosophy as a form of idealism, though other scholars have defended alternative interpretations. According to Wing-tsit Chan, since Huayan patriarch Fazang sees the One Mind as the basis for all things, including the external world, his system is one of objective idealism. A key distinction between Huayan's view of the world and that of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school is that in Huayan, there is a single intersubjective world (which nevertheless arises from mind), while Yog\u0101c\u0101ra holds that each mindstream projects its own world out of their underlying root consciousness.\nChinese Buddhist idealism also influenced Confucian philosophy through the work of thinkers like the Ming era (1368\u20131644) neo-confucian Wang Yangming (1472\u20131529). Wang's thought has been interpreted as a kind of idealism. According to Wang, the ultimate principle or pattern (l\u01d0) of the whole universe is identical with the mind, which forms one body or substance (y\u00ec t\u01d0) with \"Heaven, Earth, and the myriad creatures\" of the world. Wang argues that only this view can explain the fact that human beings experience innate care and benevolence for others as well as a sense of care for inanimate objects. Wang's thought, along with that of Lu Xiangshan, led to the creation of the School of Mind, an important Neo-Confucian tradition which emphasized these idealist views.\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra idealism saw a revival in the 20th century, associated figures like Yang Wenhui (1837\u20131911), Taixu, Liang Shuming, Ouyang Jingwu (1870\u20131943), Wang Xiaoxu (1875\u20131948), and Lu Cheng. Modern Chinese thinkers associated with consciousness-only linked the philosophy with Western philosophy (especially Hegelian and Kantian thought) and modern science. A similar trend occurred among some Japanese philosophers like Inoue Enry\u014d, who linked East Asian philosophies like Huayan with the philosophy of Hegel.\nBoth modern Chinese Buddhists and New Confucian thinkers participated in this revival of consciousness-only studies. The thought of New Confucians like Xiong Shili, Ma Yifu, Tang Junyi and Mou Zongsan, was influenced by Yog\u0101c\u0101ra consciousness-only philosophy, as well as by the metaphysics of the Awakening of Faith in the Mah\u0101y\u0101na, though their thought also contained many critiques of Buddhist philosophy.\n\n\n## Modern philosophy\n\nIt is only in the modern era that idealism became a central topic of argumentation among Western philosophers. This was also when the term \"idealism\" coined by Christian Wolff (1679\u20131754), though previous thinkers like Berkeley had argued for it under different names.\nIdealistic tendencies can be found in the work of some rationalist philosophers, like Leibniz and Nicolas Malebranche (though they did not use the term). Malebranche argued that Platonic ideas (which exist only in the mind of God) are the ultimate ground of our experiences and of the physical world, a view that prefigures later idealist positions. Some scholars also see Leibniz' philosophy as approaching idealism. Guyer et al. write that \"his view that the states of monads can be only perceptions and appetitions (desires) suggests a metaphysical argument for idealism, while his famous thesis that each monad represents the entire universe from its own point of view might be taken to be an epistemological ground for idealism, even if he does not say as much.\" However, there is still much debate in the contemporary scholarly literature on whether Leibniz can be considered an idealist.\n\n\n### Subjective idealism\n\nOne famous proponent of modern idealism was Bishop George Berkeley (1685\u20131753), an Anglo-Irish philosopher who defended a theory he called immaterialism. This kind of idealism is sometimes also called subjective idealism (also known as phenomenalistic idealism).\nBerkeley held that objects exist only to the extent that a mind perceives them and thus the physical world does not exist outside of mind. Berkeley's epistemic argument for this view (found in his A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge) rests on the premise that we can only know ideas in the mind. Thus, knowledge does not extend to mind-independent things (Treatise, 1710: Part I, \u00a72). From this, Berkeley holds that \"the existence of an idea consists in being perceived\", thus, regarding ideas \"their esse is percipi\", that is, to be is to be perceived (1710: Part I, \u00a73).\nBased on this restriction of existence to only what is being perceived, Berkeley holds that it is meaningless to think that there could exist objects that are not being perceived. This is the basic idea behind what has been called Berkeley's \"master argument\" for idealism, which states that \"one cannot conceive of anything existing unconceived because in trying to do so one is still conceiving of the object\" (1710: Part I, \u00a723). As to the question of how objects which are currently not being perceived by individual minds persist in the world, Berkeley answers that a single eternal mind keeps all of physical reality stable (and causes ideas in the first place), and this is God.\nBerkeley also argued for idealism based on a second key premise: \"an idea can be like nothing but an idea\" and as such there cannot be any things without or outside mind. This is because for something to be like something else, there must be something they have in common. If something is mind independent, then it must be completely different from ideas. Thus, there can be no relation between ideas in the mind and things \"without the mind\", since they are not alike. As Berkeley writes, \"...I ask whether those supposed originals or external things, of which our ideas are the pictures or representations, be themselves perceivable or no? if they are, then they are ideas, and we have gained our point; but if you say they are not, I appeal to any one whether it be sense, to assert a colour is like something which is invisible; hard or soft, like something which is intangible; and so of the rest.\" (1710: Part I, \u00a78).\nA similar idealistic philosophy was developed at around the same time as Berkeley by Anglican priest and philosopher Arthur Collier (Clavis Universalis: Or, A New Inquiry after Truth, Being a Demonstration of the Non-Existence, or Impossibility, of an External World, 1713). Collier claimed to have developed his view that all matter depends on mind independently of Berkeley. Paul Brunton, a British philosopher and mystic, also taught a similar type of idealism called \"mentalism\".\nA. A. Luce and John Foster are other subjective idealists. Luce, in Sense without Matter (1954), attempts to bring Berkeley up to date by modernizing his vocabulary and putting the issues he faced in modern terms, and treats the Biblical account of matter and the psychology of perception and nature. Foster's The Case for Idealism argues that the physical world is the logical creation of natural, non-logical constraints on human sense-experience. Foster's latest defense of his views (phenomenalistic idealism) is in his book A World for Us: The Case for Phenomenalistic Idealism.\nCritics of subjective idealism include Bertrand Russell's popular 1912 book  The Problems of Philosophy, Australian philosopher David Stove, Alan Musgrave, and John Searle.\n\n\n### Epistemic idealism\n\n\n=### Kant's Transcendental idealism=\n\nTranscendental idealism was developed by Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804), who was the first philosopher to label himself an \"idealist\". In his Critique of Pure Reason, Kant was clear to distinguish his view (which he also called \"critical\" and \"empirical realism\") from Berkeley's idealism and from Descartes's views. Kant's philosophy holds that we only have knowledge of our experiences, which consists jointly of intuitions and concepts. As such, our experiences reflect our cognitive structures, not the intrinsic nature of mind-independent things. This means even time and space are not properties of things in themselves (i.e. mind independent reality underlying appearances).\nSince it focuses on the mind dependent nature of knowledge and not on metaphysics per se, transcendental idealism is a type of epistemological idealism. Unlike metaphysical forms of idealism, Kant's transcendental idealism does not deny the existence of mind independent things or affirm that they must be mental. He thus accepts that we can conceive of external objects as distinct from our representations of them. However, he argues that we cannot know what external objects are \"in themselves\". As such, Kant's system can be called idealist in some respects (e.g. regarding space and time) and also realist in that he accepts there must be some mind independent reality (even if we cannot know its ultimate nature and thus must remain agnostic about this). Kant's system also affirms the reality of a free truly existent self and of a God, which he sees as being possible because the non-temporal nature of the thing-in-itself allows for a radical freedom and genuine spontaneity.\nKant's main argument for his idealism, found throughout the Critique of Pure Reason, is based on the key premise that we always represent objects in space and time through our a priori intuitions (knowledge which is independent from any experience). Thus, according to Kant, space and time can never represent any \"property at all of any things in themselves nor any relations of them to each other, i.e., no determination of them that attaches to objects themselves and that would remain even if one were to abstract from all subjective conditions of intuition\" (CPuR A 26/B 42).\n\nKant's main point is that since our mental representations have spatio-temporal structure, we have no real grounds for positing that the real objects our mind represents in this way also have spatio-temporal structure in themselves. Kant makes this argument in different parts of the Critique, such as when he asks rhetorically:If there did not lie in you a faculty for intuiting a priori; if this subjective condition were not at the same time the universal a priori condition under which alone the object of ... intuition is possible; if the object ([e.g.,] the triangle) were something in itself without relation to your subject: then how could you say that what necessarily lies in your subjective conditions for constructing a triangle must also necessarily pertain to the triangle in itself. (A 48/B 65)Throughout his career, Kant labored to distinguish his philosophy from metaphysical idealism, as some of his critics charged him with being a Berkeleyian idealist. He argued that even if we cannot know how things are in themselves, we do know they must exist, and that we know this \"through the representations which their influence on our sensibility provides for us.\" In the second edition of his Critique, he even inserted a \"refutation of idealism\". For Kant, \"the perception of this persistent thing is possible only through a thing outside me and not through the mere representation of a thing outside me.\"\n\n\n=### Neo-Kantianism=\nKant's philosophy was extremely influential on European enlightenment thinkers (and counter-enlightenment ones as well), and his ideas were widely discussed and debated. Transcendental idealism was also defended by later Kantian philosophers who adopted his method, such as Karl Leonhard Reinhold and Jakob Sigismund Beck.\nThe mid-19th century saw a revival of Kantian philosophy, which became known as Neo-Kantianism, with its call of \"Back to Kant\". This movement was especially influential on 19th century German academic philosophy (and also continental philosophy as a whole). Some important figures include: Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918), Wilhelm Windelband (1848\u20131914), Ernst Cassirer, Hermann von Helmholtz, Eduard Zeller, Leonard Nelson, Heinrich Rickert, and Friedrich Albert Lange. A key concern of the Neo-Kantians was to update Kantian epistemology, particularly in order to provide an epistemic basis for the modern sciences (all while avoiding ontology altogether, whether idealist or materialist). Neo-Kantianism rejected metaphysical idealism while also accepting the basic Kantian premise that \"our experience of reality is always structured by the distinctive features of human mentality.\" Hence, Cassirer defended an epistemic worldview that held that one cannot reduce reality to any independent or substantial object (physical or mental), instead, there are only different ways of describing and organizing experience.\nNeo-Kantianism influenced the work of the Vienna circle and its ambassadors to the Anglophone world, Rudolf Carnap 1891\u20131970) and Hans Reichenbach. Charles Bernard Renouvier was the first philosopher in France to formulate a system based on Kant's critical idealism, which he termed Neo-criticism (n\u00e9o-criticisme). It is a transformation rather than a continuation of Kantianism.\n\n\n### German idealism\n\nSeveral important German thinkers who were deeply influenced by Kant are the German idealists: Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762\u20131814), Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775\u20131854), and Georg Friedrich Hegel (1770\u20131831). Though heavily drawing on Kant, these thinkers were not transcendental idealists as such, and they sought to move beyond the idea that things in themselves are unknowable \u2013an idea they considered as opening the door to skepticism and nihilism.\nPost-Kantian German idealists thus rejected transcendental idealism by arguing against the opposition of a mind-independent world of being and a subjective world of mental constructs (or the separation between the knowledge and what is known, between subject and object, real and ideal). This new German idealism was distinguished by an \"inseparability of being and thinking\" and \"a dynamic conception of self-consciousness\" that sees reality as spontaneous conscious activity and its expressions. As such, this kind of metaphysical idealism, focused on dynamic processes and forces, was opposed to older forms of idealism, which based itself on substance theory (which these Germans labeled \"dogmatism\").\nThe first thinker to elaborate this type of dynamic idealism was J. G. Fichte (Doctrine of Wissenschaft, 1810\u20131813). For Fichte, the primordial act at the ground of being is called \"self-positing\". Fichte argues that self-consciousness or the I is a spontaneous unconditioned self-creating act which he also called the deed-act (tathandlung). Fichte argues that positing something unconditioned and independent at the ground of all is the only way to avoid an epistemic infinite regress. According to Fichte, this \"I am\" or \"absolute subject\" which \"originally posits its own being absolutely\" (Doctrine I, 2: 261), \"is at the same time the actor and the product of the act; the actor, and that which the activity brings forth; act and deed are one and the same\" (Doctrine I, 2: 259). Fichte also argues that this \"I\" has the capacity to \"counter-posit\" a \"not-I\", leading to a subject-object relationship. The I also has a third capacity Fichte calls \"divisibility\", which allows for the existence of plurality in the world, which however must be understood as manifestations of the \"I-activity\", and as being \"within the I\".\nFichte's philosophy was adopted by Schelling who defended this new idealism as a full monistic ontology which tried to account for all of nature which he would eventually name \"absolute idealism\". For Schelling, reality is an \"original unity\" (urspr\u00fcngliche Einheit) or a \"primordial totality\" (uranf\u00e4ngliche Ganzheit) of opposites. This is an absolute which he described as an \"eternal act of cognition\" is disclosed in subjective and objective modes, the world of ideas and nature. \n\nG. W. F. Hegel also defended a dynamic absolute idealism that sees existence as an all-inclusive whole. However, his system differs from his predecessors' in that it is not grounded on some initial subject, mind, or \"I\" and tries to move beyond all bifurcation subject and object, of the dualism between thinking and being (which for Hegel just leads to various contradictions). As such, Hegel's system is an ontological monism fundamentally based on a unity between being and thought, subject and object, which he saw as being neither materialistic realism nor subjective idealism (which still stands in an opposition to materialism and thus remains stuck in the subject-object distinction).\nIn his Phenomenology of Spirit (1807), Hegel provides an epistemological argument for idealism, focusing on proving the \"metaphysical priority of identities over and against their opposed elements\". Hegel's argument begins with his conception of knowledge, which he holds is a relation between a claim about a subject and an object that allows for a correspondence between their structural features (and is thus a type of correspondence theory). Hegel argues that if knowledge is possible, real objects must also have a similar structure as thought (without, however, being reduced to thoughts). If not, there could be no correspondence between what the object is and what a subject believes to be true about the object. For Hegel, any system in which the subject that knows and the object which is known are structurally independent would make the relations necessary for knowledge impossible. Hegel also argues that finite qualities and objects depend on other finite things to determine them. An infinite thinking being, on the other hand, would be more self-determining and hence most fully real.\nHegel argued that a careful analysis of the act of knowledge would eventually lead to an understanding of the unity of subjects and the objects in a single all-encompassing whole. In this system, experiences are not independent of the thing in itself (as in Kant) but are manifestations grounded in a metaphysical absolute, which is also experiential (but since it resists the experiential subject, can be known through this resistance). Thus, our own experiences can lead us to an insight into the thing in itself. Furthermore, since reality is a unity, all knowledge is ultimately self-knowledge, or as Hegel puts it, it is the subject being \"in the other with itself\" (im Anderen bei sich selbst sein). Since all things have spirit (Geist), a philosopher can attain what he termed \"absolute knowing\" (absolutes Wissen), which is the knowledge that all things are ultimately manifestations of an infinite absolute spirit.\nLater, in his Science of Logic (1812\u20131814), Hegel further develops a metaphysics in which the real and objective activity of thinking unfolds itself in numerous ways (as objects and subjects). This ultimate activity of thought, which is not the activity of specific subjects, is an immediate fact, a given (vorhandenes), which is self-standing and self-organizing. In manifesting the entire world, the absolute enacts a process of self-actualization through a grand structure or master logic, which is what Hegel calls \"reason\" (Vernunft), and which he understands as a teleological reality.\nHegelianism was deeply influential throughout the 19th century, even as some Hegelians (like Marx) rejected idealism. Later idealist Hegelians include Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg (1802\u201372) and Rudolf Hermann Lotze (1817\u201381).\n\n\n### Schopenhauer's philosophy\nThe philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer owes much to the thought of Kant and to that of the German idealists, which he nevertheless strongly criticizes. Schopenhauer maintains Kant's idealist epistemology which sees even space, time and causality as mere mental representations (vorstellungen) conditioned by the subjective mind. However, he replaces Kant's unknowable thing-in-itself with an absolute reality underlying all ideas that is a single irrational Will, a view that he saw as directly opposed to Hegel's rational Spirit. This philosophy is laid out in The World as Will and Representation (WWR 1818, 2nd ed. 1844).\nSchopenhauer accepts Kant's view that there can be no appearances without there being something which appears. However, unlike Kant, Schopenhauer writes that \"we have immediate cognition of the thing in itself when it appears to us as our own body\". (WWR \u00a76, pp. 40\u20131). Schopenhauer argues that, even though we do experience our own bodies through the categories of space, time and causality, we also experience it in another more direct and internal way through the experience of willing. This immediate experience reveals that it is will alone which \"gives him the key to his own appearance, reveals to him the meaning and shows him the inner workings of his essence, his deeds, his movements\" (WWR \u00a718, p. 124). Thus, for Schopenhauer, it is desire, a \"dark, dull driving\", which is at the root of action, not reason. Furthermore, since this is the only form of insight we have of the inner essence of any reality, we must apply this insight \"to [the] appearances in the inorganic [and organic] world as well.\" Schopenhauer compares willing with many natural forces. As such, Will is \"a name signifying the being in itself of every thing in the world and the sole kernel of every appearance\" (WWR \u00a723, pp. 142\u20133).\nBecause irrational Willing is the most foundational reality, life is filled with frustration, irrationality and disappointment. This is the metaphysical foundation of Schopenhauer's pessimistic philosophy of life. The best we can hope for is to deny and try to escape (however briefly) the incessant force of the Will, through art, aesthetic experience, asceticism, and compassion.\n\n\n### Gentile's actual idealism\nActual idealism is a form of idealism developed by Giovanni Gentile which argues that reality is the ongoing act of thinking, or in Italian \"pensiero pensante\" and thus, only thoughts exist. He further argued that our combined thoughts defined and produced reality. Gentile also nationalizes this idea, holding that the state is a composition of many minds coming together to construct reality. Giovanni Gentile was a key supporter of fascism, regarded by many as the \"philosopher of fascism\". His idealist theory argued for the unity of all society under one leader, which allows it to act as one body.\n\n\n### Anglo-American Idealism\nIdealism was widespread in Anglo-American philosophy during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It was the dominant metaphysics in the English speaking world during the last decades of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century. During this time, the defenders of British idealism made significant contributions to all fields of philosophy. However, other philosophers, like McTaggart, broke from this trend and instead defended a pluralistic idealism in which the ultimate reality is a plurality of minds.\nMany Anglo-American idealists were influenced by Hegelianism, but they also drew on Kant, Plato and Aristotle. Key figures of this transatlantic movement include many of the British idealists, such as T. H. Green (1836\u20131882), F. H. Bradley (1846\u20131924), Bernard Bosanquet (1848\u20131923), J. H. Muirhead (1855\u20131940), H. H. Joachim (1868\u20131938), A. E. Taylor (1869\u20131945), R. G. Collingwood (1889\u20131943), G. R. G. Mure (1893\u20131979) and Michael Oakeshott. American idealist philosophers include Josiah Royce (1855\u20131916) and Brand Blanshard (1892\u20131987).\n\n\n=### British absolute idealism=\n\nOne of the early influential British idealists was Thomas Hill Green, known for his posthumous Prolegomena to Ethics. Green argues for an idealist metaphysics in this text as a foundation for free will and ethics. In a Kantian fashion, Green first argues that knowledge consists in seeing relations in consciousness, and that any sense of something being \"real\" or \"objective\" has no meaning outside of consciousness. He then argues that experience as consciousness of related events \"cannot be explained by any natural history, properly so called\" and thus \"the understanding which presents an order of nature to us is in principle one with an understanding which constitutes that order itself.\"\nGreen then further argues that individual human beings are aware of an order of relations which extends beyond the bounds of their individual mind. For Green, this greater order must be in a larger transpersonal intelligence, while the world is \"a system of related facts\" which is made possible and revealed to individual beings by the larger intelligence. Furthermore, Green also holds that participation in the transpersonal mind is constituted by the apprehension of a portion of the overall order by animal organisms. As such, Green accepts the reality of biological bodies when he writes that \"in the process of our learning to know the world, an animal organism, which has its history in time, gradually becomes the vehicle of an eternally complete consciousness.\"\nAnother paradigmatic British absolute idealist is Francis Herbert Bradley, who affirms that \"the Absolute is not many; there are no independent reals\". This absolute reality \"is one system, and ... its contents are nothing but sentient experience. It will hence be a single and all-inclusive experience, which embraces every partial diversity in concord.\" Bradley presents an anti-realist idealism which rejects the ultimate reality of relations, which for him are mere appearance, \"a makeshift, a mere practical compromise, most necessary, but in the end most indefensible.\"\nBradley presented his idealism in his Appearance and Reality (1893) by arguing that the ideas we use to understand reality are contradictory. He deconstructs numerous ideas including primary and secondary qualities, substances and attributes, quality and relation, space, time and causality and the self. Most famously, Bradley argued that any ultimate distinction between qualities and relations is untenable since \"qualities are nothing without relations\" since \"their plurality depends on relation, and, without that relation, they are not distinct. But, if not distinct, then not different, and therefore not qualities.\" Furthermore, for Bradley, the same thing turns out to be true of relations, and of both taken together, since for a relation to relate to a quality, it would then require a further relation. As such, qualities and relations are appearance, not ultimate truth, since \"ultimate reality is such that it does not contradict itself\".\nEven though all appearances are \"not truth\", it is still possible to have true knowledge of ultimate reality, which must be a unity beyond contradictions but which still allows for diversity. Bradley thinks that this character of reality as a diverse unity is revealed to us in sentient experience, since our various experiences must be grounded and caused by some undifferentiated and pre-abstract reality. However he also admits \"our complete inability to understand this concrete unity in detail\".\n\n\n=### American idealism=\n\nIdealism also became popular in the United States with thinkers like Charles Sanders Peirce (1839\u20131914), who defended an \"objective idealism\" in which, as he put it, \"matter is effete mind, inveterate habits becoming physical laws\". Peirce initially defended a type of representationalism alongside his form of Pragmatism which was metaphysically neutral since it is \"no doctrine of metaphysics\". However, in later years (after c.1905), Peirce defended an objective idealism which held that the universe evolved from a state of maximum spontaneous freedom (which he associated with mind) into its present state where matter were merely \"congealed\" mind. In arguing for this view, he followed the classic idealist premise that states there must be a metaphysical equality (an isomorphism) between thought and being, and as such, \"the root of all being is One\". A key feature of Peirce's idealism is \"Tychism\", which he defined as \"the doctrine that absolute chance is a factor of the universe.\" This allows for an element of chance or indeterminism in the universe which allows for cosmological evolution.\nUnder the influence of Peirce, it was Josiah Royce (1855\u20131916) who became the leading American idealist at the turn of the century. Royce's idealism incorporated aspects of Peirce's Pragmatism and is defended in his The Spirit of Modern Philosophy (1892). One of Royce's arguments for idealism is his argument from meaning, which states the possibility of there being meaning at all requires an identity between what is meant (ordinary objects) and what makes meaning (ordinary subjects).\nIn his The World and the Individual (2 vols, 1899 and 1901), Royce also links meaning with purpose, seeing the meaning of a term as its intended purpose. Royce was an absolute idealist who held that ultimately reality was a super-self, an absolute mind. Royce argues that for a mind to be able represent itself and its representations (and not lead to a vicious infinite regress), it must be complex and capacious enough, and only an absolute mind has this capacity.\nThe American philosopher Brand Blanshard (1892\u20131987) was also a proponent of idealism who accepted a \"necessary isomorphism between knowledge and its object\". His idealism is most obvious in The Nature of Thought (1939), where he discusses how all perception is infused with concepts. He then argues from a coherence theory of truth that the \"character of reality\" must also include coherence itself, and thus, knowledge must be similar to what it knows. Not only that, but knowledge must be part of a single system with the world it knows, and causal relations must be also involve logical relations. These considerations lead to an idealism which sees the world as system of relations that cannot be merely physical.\n\n\n### Pluralistic idealism\nPluralistic idealism takes the view that there are many individual minds, monads, or processes that together underlie the existence of the observed world and which make possible the existence of the physical universe. Pluralistic idealism does not assume the existence of a single ultimate mind or absolute as with the total monism of absolute idealism, instead it affirms an ultimate plurality of ideas or beings.\n\n\n=### Personalism=\nPersonalism is the view that the individual minds of persons or selves are the basis for ultimate reality and value and as such emphasizes the fundamentality and inherent worth of persons. Modern personalist idealism emerged during the reaction against what was seen as a dehumanizing impersonalism of absolute idealism, a reaction which was led by figures like Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881). Personalists affirmed personal freedom against what they saw as a monism that lead to totalitarianism by subordinating the individual to the collective.\nSome idealistic personalists defended a theistic personalism (often influenced by Aquinas) in which reality is a society of minds ultimately dependent on a supreme person (God). Defenders of a Theistic and idealistic personalism include Borden Parker Bowne (1847\u20131910), Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison (1856\u20131931), Edgar S. Brightman and George Holmes Howison (1834\u20131916). These theistic personalists emphasize the dependence of all individual minds on God.\nHowever, other personalists like British idealist J. M. E. McTaggart and Thomas Davidson merely argued for a community of individual minds or spirits, without positing a supreme personal deity who creates or grounds them. Similarly, James Ward (1843\u20131925) was inspired by Leibniz to defend a form of pluralistic idealism in which the universe is composed of \"psychic monads\" of different levels, interacting for mutual self-betterment.\nAmerican personalism was particularly associated with idealism and with Boston university, where Bowne (who had studied with Lotze) developed his personalist idealism and published his Personalism (1908). Bowne's students, like Edgar Sheffield Brightman, Albert C. Knudson (1873\u20131953), Francis J. McConnell (1871\u20131953), and Ralph T. Flewelling (1871\u20131960), continued to develop his personal idealism after his death. The \"Boston personalism\" tradition also influenced the later work of Peter A. Bertocci (1910\u20131989), as well as the ideas of Martin Luther King Jr., who studied at Boston University with personalist philosophers and was shaped by their worldview.\nGeorge Holmes Howison meanwhile, developed his own brand of \"California personalism\". Howison argued that both impersonal monistic idealism and materialism run contrary to the experience of moral freedom, while \"personal idealism\" affirms it. To deny freedom to pursue truth, beauty, and \"benignant love\" is to undermine every profound human venture, including science, morality, and philosophy. Howison, in his book The Limits of Evolution and Other Essays Illustrating the Metaphysical Theory of Personal Idealism, developed a democratic idealism that extended all the way to God, who instead of a monarch, was seen as the ultimate democrat in eternal relation to other eternal persons.\nAnother pluralistic idealism was Thomas Davidson's (1840\u20131900) \"apeirotheism\", which he defined as \"a theory of Gods infinite in number\". The theory was indebted to Aristotle's view of the eternal rational soul and the nous. Identifying Aristotle's God with rational thought, Davidson argued, contrary to Aristotle, that just as the soul cannot exist apart from the body, God cannot exist apart from the world.\nAnother influential British idealist, J. M. E. McTaggart (1866\u20131925), defended a theory in which reality is a community of individual spirits connected by the relation of love. McTaggart defends ontological idealism through a mereological argument which argues only spirits can be substances, as well as through an argument for the unreality of time (a position he also defends in The Unreality of Time).\nIn The Nature of Existence (1927), McTaggart's argument relies on the premise that substances are infinitely divisible and cannot have simple parts. Furthermore, each of their infinite parts determines every other part. He then analyzes various characteristics of reality such as time, matter, sensation, and cogitation and attempts to show they cannot be real elements of real substances, but must be mere appearances. For example, the existence of matter cannot be inferred based on sensations, since they cannot be divided to infinity (and thus cannot be substances). Spirits on the other hand are true infinitely divisible substances. They have \"the quality of having content, all of which is the content of one or more selves\", and know themselves through direct perception as substances persisting through time. For McTaggart, there is a multiplicity of spirits, which are nevertheless related to each other harmoniously through their love for each other.\nMcTaggart also criticizes Hegel's view of the state in his Studies in Hegelian Cosmology (1901), arguing that metaphysics can give very little guidance to social and political action, just like it can give us very little guidance in other practical matters, like engineering.\n\n\n### Contemporary idealism\n\nToday, idealism remains a minority view in Western analytic circles. In spite of this, the study of the work of the Anglo-American idealists saw a revival in the 21st century with an increase in publications at the turn of the century, and they are now considered to have made important contributions to philosophy.\nSeveral modern figures continue to defend idealism. Recent idealist philosophers include A. A. Luce (Sense without Matter, 1954), Timothy Sprigge (The Vindication of Absolute Idealism, 1984), Leslie Armour, Vittorio H\u00f6sle (Objective Idealism, 1998), John Andrew Foster (A World for Us, 2008), John A. Leslie (Infinite Minds: A Philosophical Cosmology, 2002), and Bernardo Kastrup (The Idea of the World, 2018). In 2022, Howard Robinson authored Perception and Idealism.\nBoth Foster and Sprigge defend idealism through an epistemic argument for the unity of the act of perception with its object. Sprigge also made an argument from grounding, which held that our phenomenal objects presuppose some noumenal ground. As such For Sprigge, the physical world \"consists in innumerable mutually interacting centres of experience, or, what comes to the same, of pulses and flows of experience.\" Thus, the noumenal ground is the totality of all experiences, which are one \"concrete universal\", that resembles Bradley's absolute.\nHelen Yetter-Chappell has defended nontheistic (quasi-)Berkeleyan idealism.\n\n\n### Idealistic theories based on 20th-century science\nIdealist notions took a strong hold among physicists of the early 20th century confronted with the paradoxes of quantum physics and the theory of relativity.\nArthur Eddington, a British astrophysicist of the early 20th century, wrote in his book The Nature of the Physical World that the stuff of the world is mind-stuff, adding that \"The mind-stuff of the world is, of course, something more general than our individual conscious minds.\" Ian Barbour, in his book Issues in Science and Religion, cites Arthur Eddington's The Nature of the Physical World (1928) as a text that argues The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principles provides a scientific basis for \"the defense of the idea of human freedom\" and his Science and the Unseen World (1929) for support of philosophical idealism \"the thesis that reality is basically mental.\"\nThe physicist Sir James Jeans wrote: \"The stream of knowledge is heading towards a non-mechanical reality; the Universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter... we ought rather hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter.\"\nThe chemist Ernest Lester Smith, a member of the occult movement Theosophy, wrote a book Intelligence Came First (1975) in which he claimed that consciousness is a fact of nature and that the cosmos is grounded in and pervaded by mind and intelligence.\n\n\n## Criticism\n\nIn the Western world, the popularity of idealism as a metaphysical view declined severely in the 20th century, especially in English language analytic philosophy. This was partly due to the criticisms of British philosophers like G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell and also due to the critiques of the American \"new realists\" like E.B. Holt, Ralph Barton Perry and Roy Wood Sellars.\nMoore famously critiqued idealism and defended realism in The Refutation of Idealism (1903), and A Defence of Common Sense (1925). In the Refutation, Moore argues that arguments for idealism most often rely on the premise that to be is to be perceived (esse est percipi), but that if this is true \"how can we infer that anything whatever, let alone everything is an inseparable aspect of any experience?\". Bertrand Russell's popular 1912 book The Problems of Philosophy also contained a similar critique. Their main objection is that idealists falsely presuppose that the mind's relation to any object is a necessary condition for the existence of the object. Russell thinks this fallacy fails to make \"the distinction between act and object in our apprehending of things\" (1912 [1974: 42]). Guyer et al. write that the success of these arguments might be controversial and that \"the charge that they simply conflate knowledge and object hardly seems to do justice to the elaborate arguments of the late nineteenth-century idealists.\" It also relies on a realist epistemology in which knowledge stands \"in an immediate relation to an independent individual object\".\nRegarding positive arguments, Moore's most famous argument for the existence of external matter (found in Proof of an External World, 1939) was an epistemological argument from common sense facts, sometimes known as \"Here is one hand\". Idealism was also more recently critiqued in the works of Australian philosopher David Stove, and by Alan Musgrave, and John Searle.\nPhysicist Milton A. Rothman has written that idealism is incompatible with science and is not considered an empirical system of knowledge unlike realism which is pragmatical and makes testable predictions. Rothman commented that \"idealism saying nothing about why ten different observers in different parts of the world measure the speed of light to be the same. If the light beam exists only a construct in my mind, then how does an experimenter in Moscow always get the same result that I do in, say Princeton\".\nPhilosopher and physicist Mario Bunge has written that idealistic thinking is often found in pseudosciences as it postulates immaterial entities that disregard scientific laws.\n\n\n## See also\n\nInnatism\nQualia\nHard problem of consciousness\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n\n## References\n\n\n\n### Primary\nBerkeley, George.

      "text": "# Intellectualization\n\nIn psychology, intellectualization (intellectualisation) is a defense mechanism by which reasoning is used to block confrontation with an unconscious conflict and its associated emotional stress \u2013 where thinking is used to avoid feeling. It involves emotionally removing one's self from a stressful event. Intellectualization may accompany, but is different from, rationalization, the pseudo-rational justification of irrational acts.\nIntellectualization was among the first defense mechanisms identified by Sigmund Freud. He believed that memories have both conscious and unconscious aspects, and that intellectualization allows for the conscious analysis of an event in a way that does not provoke anxiety.\n\n\n## Description\n\nIntellectualization is a transition to reason, where the person avoids uncomfortable emotions by focusing on facts and logic. The situation is treated as an interesting problem that engages the person on a rational basis, whilst the emotional aspects are completely ignored as being irrelevant. \nWhile Freud did not himself use the term \"intellectualization\", in  On Negation he described clinical instances in which \"the intellectual function is separated from the affective process....The outcome of this is a kind of intellectual acceptance of the repressed, while at the same time what is essential to the repression persists\". Elsewhere he described an (unsuccessful) analysis with \"the patient participating actively with her intellect, though absolutely tranquil emotionally...completely indifferent\", while he also noted how in the obsessional the thinking processes themselves become sexually charged.\nAnna Freud devoted a chapter of her book The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense [1937] to \"Intellectualization at Puberty\", seeing the growing intellectual and philosophical approach of that period as relatively normal attempts to master adolescent drives.  She considered that only \"if the process of intellectualization overruns the whole field of mental life\" should it be considered pathological.\nJargon is often used as a device of intellectualization. By using complex terminology, the focus becomes on the words and finer definitions rather than the human effects.\nIntellectualization protects against anxiety by repressing the emotions connected with an event. A comparison sometimes made is that between isolation (also known as isolation of affect) and intellectualization.  The former is a dissociative response that allows one to dispassionately experience an unpleasant thought or event. The latter is a cognitive style that seeks to conceptualize an unpleasant thought or event in an intellectually comprehensible manner. The DSM-IV-TR thus mentions them as separate entities. It allows one to rationally deal with a situation, but may cause suppression of feelings that need to be acknowledged to move on.\n\n\n## In the defense hierarchy\n\nGeorge Vaillant divided defense mechanisms into a hierarchy of defenses ranging from immature through neurotic to healthy defenses,  and placed intellectualization \u2013 imagining an act of violence without feeling the accompanying emotions, for example \u2013 in the mid-range, neurotic defenses. Like rationalisation, intellectualization can thus provide a bridge between immature and mature mechanisms both in the process of growing up and in adult life.\nDonald Winnicott, however, considered that erratic childhood care could lead to over-dependence on intellectuality as a substitute for mothering; and saw over-preoccupation with knowledge as an emotional impoverishment aimed at self-mothering via the mind. Julia Kristeva similarly described a process whereby \"symbolicity itself is cathected...Since it is not sex-oriented, it denies the question of sexual difference\". \nOne answer to such over-intellectualization may be the sense of humour, what Richard Hofstadter called the necessary quality of playfulness \u2013 Freud himself saying that \"Humour can be regarded as the highest of these defensive processes\"!\n\n\n## During therapy\n\nAmong the intellectual defenses against analysis are a refusal to accept the logic of emotions, attempts to refute the theory of psychoanalysis, or speculating about one's own problems rather than experiencing them and attempting to change.\nSuch intellectualizations of therapy may form part of wider manic defenses against emotional reality. A further difficulty may be that of assimilating new and unfamiliar feelings once the defense of intellectualization begins to crack open.\nAlternatively the therapist may unwittingly deflect the patient away from feeling to mere talking of feelings, producing not emotional but merely intellectual insight  an obsessional attempt to control through thinking the lost feelings parts of the self. As Jung put it, \"the intellectual still suffers from a neurosis if feeling is undeveloped\".\n\n\n## Psychoanalytic controversy\n\nFreud's theory of psychoanalysis may be a formidable intellectual construct, but it has certainly been criticised for revealing intellectual grandiosity.\nJacques Lacan, however, would defend it on the very ground of its intellectuality, arguing that you could \"recognize bad psychoanalysts...by the word they use to deprecate all technical or theoretical research...intellectualization\".  Lacan himself was of course exposed to exactly the same criticism: \"My own conception of the dynamics of the unconscious has been called an intellectualization \u2013 on the grounds that I based the function of the signifier in the forefront\".\nFreud himself accepted that he had a vast desire for knowledge and knew well how theorising could become a compulsive activity. He might not have disagreed too strongly with Didier Anzieu's assessment of the extent to which \"his elaboration of psychoanalytic theory...corresponded to a setting up of obsessional defenses against depressive anxiety\" \u2013 of Freud's need \"to defend himself against [anxiety] through such a degree of intellectualisation\".\n\n\n## Examples\n\n",

      "text": "# Interference_theory\n\nThe interference theory is a theory regarding human memory. Interference occurs in learning. The notion is that memories encoded in long-term memory (LTM) are forgotten and cannot be retrieved into short-term memory (STM) because either memory could interfere with the other. There is an immense number of encoded memories within the storage of LTM. The challenge for memory retrieval is recalling the specific memory and working in the temporary workspace provided in STM. Retaining information regarding the relevant time of encoding memories into LTM influences interference strength.\nThere are two types of interference effects: proactive and retroactive interference.\n\n\n## History\n\nJohn A. Bergstr\u00f6m is credited with conducting the first study regarding interference in 1892. His experiment was similar to the Stroop task and required subjects to sort two decks of cards with words into two piles. When the location was changed for the second pile, sorting was slower, demonstrating that the first set of sorting rules interfered with learning the new set. German psychologists continued in the field with Georg Elias M\u00fcller and Pilzecker in 1900 studying retroactive interference. To the confusion of Americans at a later date, M\u00fcller used \"associative Hemmung\" (inhibition) as a blanket term for retroactive and proactive inhibition.\nThe next major advancement came from American psychologist Benton J. Underwood in 1957. Underwood revisited the classic Ebbinghaus learning curve and found that most of the forgetting was due to interference from previously learned materials.\nIn 1924, John G. Jenkins and Karl Dallenbach showed that everyday experiences can interfere with memory, employing an experiment that showed that retention was better throughout sleep than over the same amount of time devoted to the activity. The United States again made headway in 1932 with John A. McGeoch suggesting that decay theory should be replaced by an interference theory. The most recent major paradigm shift came when Underwood proposed that proactive inhibition is more important or meaningful than retroactive inhibition in accounting for forgetting.\n\n\n## Proactive interference\n\nProactive interference is the interference of older memories with the retrieval of newer memories. Of the two effects of interference theory, proactive interference is the less common and less problematic type of interference compared to retroactive interference. Previously, it had been hypothesized that forgetting working memories would be nonexistent if not for proactive interference.\n\n\n### Context\nProactive interference build-up occurs with memories being learned in similar contexts. A common example is observing previous motor abilities from one skill interfering with a new set of motor abilities being learned in another skill from the initial. Proactive interference is also associated with poorer list discrimination, which occurs when participants are asked to judge whether an item has appeared on a previously learned list. If the items or pairs to be learned are conceptually related to one another, then proactive interference has a greater effect. Delos Wickens discovered that proactive interference build-up is released when there is a change to the category of items being learned, leading to increased processing in STM. Presenting new skills later in practice can considerably reduce proactive interference desirable for participants to have the best opportunity to encode fresh new memories into LTM.\n\n\n### Brain structures\nThe leading experimental technique for studying proactive interference in the brain is the \"recent-probes\" task. Initially, this is when participants must commit a set of items to memory. They then ask them to recall a specific item. Assessing them is shown by a probe. Thus, using recent-probes task and fMRIs, the brain mechanisms involved in resolving proactive interference identify as the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the left anterior prefrontal cortex.\n\n\n### Research\n\n\n=### With lists=\nResearchers have studied the joint influence of proactive and retroactive interference using a list of items to be remembered. As expected, the recall was hampered by increasing the number of items in a given list. Proactive interference also affected learning when dealing with multiple lists. Researchers had participants learn a list of ten paired adjectives. The experimenters would consider a list to be learned if the participant could correctly recall eight of the ten items. After two days, participants could recall close to 70% of the items. However, those asked to memorize a new list the day after learning the first one had a recall of only 40%. Those who learned a third list recalled 25% of the items. Therefore, proactive interference affected the correct recall of the last list learned, because of the previous one, or two. In terms of forgetting, the effect of proactive interference was supported by further studies using different methods. The effect of proactive interference was reduced when the test was immediate and when the new target list was different from the previously learned lists.\n\n\n=### Span performance=\nSpan performance refers to working memory capacity. It is hypothesized that span performance is limited in language comprehension, problem-solving, and memory.  Proactive Interference affects susceptibility to span performance limitations, as span performance in later experimental trials were worse than performance in earlier trials. With single tasks, proactive interference had less effect on participants with high working memory spans than those with low ones. With dual tasks, both types were similarly susceptible.\nTo differ, others have tried to investigate the relation of proactive interference when cued to forget. Turvey and Wittlinger designed an experiment to examine the effects of cues such as \"not to remember\" and \"not to recall\" with currently learned material. While \"not to remember\" had a significant effect in reducing proactive interference, cued to \"not to recall\" previously encoded and stored information did not significantly reduce the effect. Therefore, these associated cues do not directly control the potential effect of proactive interference on short-term memory span.\nProactive interference has shown an effect during the learning phase in terms of stimuli at the acquisition and retrieval stages with behavioral tasks for humans, as found by Castro, Ortega, and Matute. With 106 participants, they investigated two main questions: if two cues are learned as predictors of the same outcome (one after the other), would the second-cue outcome association be retarded? And secondly, once the second association is fully learned, will there still be an effect on subsequent trials? The research, as predicted, showed retardation and impairment in associations, due to the effect of Proactive Interference.\n\n\n## Retroactive interference\n\nRetroactive interference, also known as Retroactive inhibition, is the interference of newer memories with the retrieval of older memories. In other words, subsequently learned memories directly contributes to the forgetting of previously learned memories. The effect of retroactive interference takes place when any type of skill has not been rehearsed over long periods. Of the two effects of interference theory, retroactive interference is considered the more common and more problematic type of interference compared to proactive interference.\nRI is a classic paradigm that was first officially termed by Muller. These memory research pioneers demonstrated that filling the retention interval (defined as the amount of time that occurs between the initial learning stage and the memory recall stage) with tasks and material caused significant interference effects with the primary learned items.\nAs compared to proactive interference, retroactive interference may have larger effects because there is not only competition involved but also unlearning.\n\n\n### Iconic research\n\n\n=### Modified (free) recall=\nBriggs's (1954) study modeled McGeoch's work on interference by setting the stage for a classic design of retroactive interference. In his study, participants were asked to learn 12 paired associates to a criterion of 100%. To ensure parsimony, these pairs can be labeled as A1-B1-, A2-B2-...A I -B I  (also called AB/AC paradigm). Briggs used a \"modified free recall\" technique by asking participants to recall an item when cued with B I . Over multiple anticipation trials, participants learned B I   items through the prompt of B I  items. After perfecting A I - B I  learning, participants were given a new list of paired associates to learn; however B I  items were replaced with C I  items (now given a list of A1-C1-, A2-C2-...A I -C I ). As the learning of A I -C I  pairs increased, the learning of A I -B I  pairs decreased. Eventually recalling the C I  items exceeded the recall of the B I  items, representing the phenomenon of retroactive interference.\nA significant part of Briggs's (1954) study was that once participants were tested after a delay of 24 hours the Bi responses spontaneously recovered and exceeded the recall of the Ci items. Briggs explained the spontaneous recovery illustration as an account of A I -B I  items competing with A I -C I  items or, as McGeoch would define it: \"a resultant [of] momentary dominance\".\n\n\n=### Modified modified free recall=\nJ.M. Barnes and B.J. Underwood (1959) expanded Briggs's (1954) study by implementing a similar procedure. The main difference in this study, however, was that, unlike Briggs's (1954) \"modified free recall\"  (MFR) task where participants gave one-item responses, Barnes and Underwood asked participants to give both List 1 and List 2 responses to each cued recall task. Participants' ability to recall both items was termed the \"modified modified free recall\" (MMFR) technique. Equivocally to Briggs's (1954) results, RI occurred when C I  recalled responses gradually came to exceed B I  responses. Barnes and Underwood argued that because there was \"unlimited recall time\" to produce multiple-item responses, the fact that A I -C I  responses still trumped A I -B I  responses represented an account of unlearning.\n\n\n### Notable research concepts\n\n\n=### Forgetting=\nSince German psychologist H. Ebbinghaus (1885, 1913) made the first scientific studies on forgetting in the late nineteenth century, further research on the rate of forgetting presented information was found to be steep. While a variety of factors play a role in affecting the rate of forgetting, the general conclusion made is that 70% of originally recalled information is initially forgotten in 24 hours after a session of practice, followed by 80% of information forgotten within 48 hours. Afterwards, forgetting diminishes at a gradual rate, which leaves about 5% to 10% of retained information available for learners to access from practice until the next session. Despite the numbers, retroactive interference can be reduced significantly by implementing over-learning practice schedules, periodic refresh sessions when practicing skills, and skill rehearsal time for the inactive periods of practicing. Continuous skills are more resistant to the rate of forgetting compared to discrete skills, which indicates that the types of skills being practiced and retroactive interference significantly interact with one another.\n\n\n### Theories\nThe phenomenon of retroactive interference is highly significant in the study of memory as it has sparked a historical and ongoing debate in regards to whether the process of forgetting is due to the interference of other competing stimuli, or rather the unlearning of the forgotten material. The important conclusion one may gain from RI is that \"forgetting is not simply a failure or weakness of the memory system\" (Bjork, 1992), but rather an integral part of our stored knowledge repertoire. Although modern cognitive researchers continue to debate the actual causes of forgetting (e.g., competition vs. unlearning), retroactive interference implies a general understanding that additional underlying processes play a role in memory.\n\n\n=### Competition=\nA standard explanation for the cause of RI is Competition. New associations compete with older associations and the more recent association would win out making it impossible to remember earlier associations. Spontaneous Recovery in MFR supports the claim of competition since after a rest period participants spontaneously remembered original pair associations that they were not able to remember right after the second test.\n\n\n=### Associative unlearning=\nThe associative unlearning hypothesis explains  RI by saying that new associations replace the old associations in memory causing the participant to forget the initial associations. Barnes and Underwood argued that A I -C I  responses still outnumber A I -B I  responses after the delay period supports the Associative Unlearning Hypothesis over Competition.\n\n\n### Brain structures\nRetroactive Interference has been localized to the left anterior ventral prefrontal cortex by magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies investigating Retroactive Interference and working memory in elderly adults. The study found that adults 55\u201367 years of age showed less magnetic activity in their prefrontal cortices than the control group. Executive control mechanisms are located in the frontal cortex and deficits in working memory show changes in the functioning of this brain area.\n\n\n### Research\n\n\n=### Pitch perception=\nRetroactive Interference has also been investigated using pitch perception as the learning medium. The researcher found that the presentation of subsequent stimuli in succession causes a decrease in recalled accuracy. Massaro found that the presentation of successive auditory tones, confused perceptual short-term memory, causing Retroactive Interference as the new tone inhibits the retrieval of previously heard tones.\n\n\n=### Motor movement=\nWohldmann, Healey, and Bourne found that Retroactive Interference also affects the retention of motor movements. Researchers found that retroactive interference affects the performance of old motor movements when newly acquired motor movements are practiced. Physical practice of newly executed motor movements decreased the retention and recall of previously learned movements. Despite the retroactive interference noted by Wohldmann et al., researchers noted that mental practice decreased the amount of retroactive interference, suggesting that mental practice is more flexible and durable over time.  This study of the superiority effect of physical practice is similar to the Word Superiority Effect made famous by Cattell.\n\n\n=### Word tasks=\nRetroactive Interference increases when the items are similar, therefore increasing association between them as shown by spreading activation. Barnes and Underwood found that when participants in the experimental condition were presented with two similar word lists, the recollection of the first-word list decreased with the presentation of the second-word list. This finding contrasts the control condition as they had little Retroactive Inference when asked to recall the first-word list after a period of unrelated activity.\n\n\n## Output interference\n\nOutput Interference occurs when the initial act of recalling specific information interferes with the retrieval of the original information.  An example scenario in which Output Interference might occur would be if one had created a list of items to purchase at a grocery store, but then, neglected to take the list when leaving home. The act of remembering a couple of items on that list decreases the probability of remembering the other items on that list.\n\n\n### Research\n\n\n=### Short-term memory=\nHenry L. Roediger III and Schmidt found that the act of retrieval can serve as the source of the failure to remember, using multiple experiments that tested the recall of categorized and paired associative lists. Three experiments were carried out where subjects were first presented with category lists, and then, asked to recall the items in the list after being shown the category name as a cue. The further the test position from the category resulted in a decline of the recall of words. A fourth experiment revealed that only recent items were present in output interference in paired associative lists.\n\n\n=### Long-term memory=\nSmith found that if categories with corresponding items were successfully recalled, a systematic decline would occur when recalling the items in a category across the output sequence. He conducted multiple experiments to determine the input conditioned necessary to produce Output Interference. In his first experiment word recall per category was greater at 60 sec than 30 sec when taking the last input category out to prevent recency effect. In his second experiment he changed the instructions, words used, and nature of the retention test, and showed with the recognition procedure, there was Output Interference but the effect was limited to the first three output positions. Even if retrieving items is necessary for a recall, it is not crucial to performance in a recognition tack. Recall of the organized information from long-term memory hurt the following item recalled. In long-term memory, Smith suggests that Output Interference has effects on extra-core material, which is represented as contextual information, rather than the core material, which is highly available as a result of organization.\n\n\n=### Effects of age=\nIn both short-term memory and long-term memory Smith measured output interference in three age groups (aged 20\u201339, 40\u201359, 60\u201380 years). The results of recall performance revealed significant differences due to age where the older group recalled fewer items than the middle group who recalled fewer items than the youngest group. Overall Smith concluded that memory decline appears with increased age with long-term memory forgetting rather than short-term memory forgetting and short-term memory was unaffected by age. However, output interference was unable to explain the memory deficit seen in older subjects.\nRecent research of adults free recall and cognitive triage displayed similar findings of recall performance being poorer in older adults compared to younger adults. Although it was also indicated that older adults had an increased susceptibility to output interference compared to younger adults and the difference increased as additional items were recalled.\n\n\n## Similar theories\n\n\n\n### Decay theory\nDecay theory outlines that memories weaken over time despite consolidation and storage. This is to say that although you remember a specific detail, over time you may have greater difficulty retrieving the detail you encoded. It has been suggested that the time interval between encoding and retrieval determines the accuracy of recall.\nA practical example of decay theory is seen in the financial sector. If you open a bank account and do not deposit or withdraw money from the account, after some time, the bank will render the account dormant. The owner of the account, then, has to reopen the account for it to remain active. The bank account (the memory) is rendered dormant (the memory weakened) over time if there is no activity on the account (if the memory is not retrieved after some time).\n\n\n=### Similarities=\nDecay theory is similar to interference theory in the way that old memories are lost over time. Memories are lost in Decay Theory by the passing of time. In Interference Theory, memories are lost due to newly acquired memories. Both Decay and Interference Theories are involved in psychological theories of forgetting.\n\n\n=### Differences=\nDecay and interference theory differ in that Interference Theory has a second stimulus that impedes the retrieval of the first stimulus. Decay Theory is caused by time itself. Decay Theory is a passive method of forgetting as no interference is produced. Interference Theory is an active process because the act of learning new information directly impedes the recollection of previously stored information.\n\n\n### Dual task interference\nDual-task interference is a kind of interference that occurs when two tasks are attempted simultaneously. Harold Pashler wrote a paper summing up the theoretical approaches to dual-task interference. The basis of his research looked at when one attempts two or more tasks at the same time, why in some cases is one successful in completing their task and in other cases not.\n\n\n=### Capacity sharing=\nPashler proposed that the brain contains one mental entity where all tasks must be carried out. A real-life example of this could be going to the dentist; the only place to have cavities filled is at a dentist's office. When the brain is attempting to complete two tasks, both tasks are present in the same mind area and compete for processing ability and speed. This relates to interference theory as the tasks compete. Interference theory says that the learning of new information decreases the retrieval of older information, and this is true for dual-task interference. The dominant task of the two inhibits the other task from completion. It is presumed that the dominant task would be a new task as a previously accomplished task would already be stored in memory. The new task would, then, be completed successfully as more mental effort is required to complete a novel task, and the previously completed task would not be completed as the new task dominated the mental capacity. Just as Interference Theory states, the completion of new tasks inhibits the completion of previously completed tasks due to capacity sharing.\n\n\n=### Cross talk models=\nCross-talk is the communication between sensory inputs, processing, and the thoughts of the individual. The theory is that if two processes are being activated, and they are not similar in any way (making cookies and going on vacation), the brain will be confused as separate cognitive areas are being activated, and there is conflicting communication between the two. Contrastingly, if the two processes are similar (making cookies and pouring milk), there will be less crosstalk and more productive and uninterrupted cognitive processing.\nCrosstalk is used by engineers to discuss the degradation of communication channels due to context dependence.\nNavon and Miller claim that Dual-Task Interference is caused by an outcome conflict, which is a result of one task producing, \"outputs, throughputs, or side effects that are harmful to the processing of the [other task]\". This is the concept of Interference Theory. The thoughts, outputs, and side effects of one task either affect the previous or subsequent recall.\n\n\n## Neurobiology\n\n\n\n### Event-related fMRI studies\n\n\n=### Stroop and Simon task=\nThe performance of Stroop and Simon tasks were monitored on 10 healthy young adults using magnetic resonance image (MRI)  scanning. Functional images were acquired at specific time intervals during each subject's scan. Brain activation during the Stroop and Simon task was remarkably similar including anterior cingulate, supplementary motor cortex, visual association cortex, inferior temporal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, inferior frontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and caudate nuclei. Interference effects in the Stroop and Simon tasks activate similar brain regions at similar time distributions.\n\n\n## Application\n\n\n\n### Advertising\nIt has been demonstrated that recall will be lower when consumers have afterward seen an ad for a competing brand in the same product class. Exposure to later similar advertisements does not cause interference for consumers when brands are rated on purchasing likelihood. This shows that information processing objective can moderate the effects of interference of competitive advertising. Competitive brand advertising not only interferes with consumer recall of advertising in the past but also interferes with learning new distinctive brand information in the future.\n\n\n=### Reducing competitive ad interference=\nRepetition improves brand name recall when presented alone. When competitive advertising was presented, it was shown that repetition provided no improvement in brand name recall over a single exposure. The competitive ads interfered with the added learning from repetition. However, when the target brand name was shown using varying ad executions interference was reduced. Presenting ads in multi-modalities (visual, auditory) will reduce possible interference because there are more associations or paths to cue recall than if only one modality had been used. This is the principle of multimedia learning. Also, interference is increased when competing ads are presented in the same modality. Therefore, by presenting ads in multiple modalities, the chance that the target brand has unique cues is increased.\n\n\n## See also\n\nNeuroimaging\nWorking memory\nMemory inhibition\nMemory conformity\nEinstellung effect\nLanguage transfer (interference between languages)\nForgetting curve\nBetween-systems memory interference model\n\n\n## References\n\n",
