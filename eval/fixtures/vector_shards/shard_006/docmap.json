      "text": "# Extinction\n\nExtinction is the termination of an organism by the death of its last member. A taxon may become functionally extinct before the death of its last member if it loses the capacity to reproduce and recover. As a species' potential range may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as Lazarus taxa, where a species presumed extinct abruptly \"reappears\" (typically in the fossil record) after a period of apparent absence.\nOver five billion species are estimated to have died out. It is estimated that there are currently around 8.7 million species of eukaryotes globally, possibly many times more if microorganisms are included. Notable extinct animal species include non-avian dinosaurs, saber-toothed cats, and mammoths. Through evolution, species arise through the process of speciation. Species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition. The relationship between animals and their ecological niches has been firmly established. A typical species becomes extinct within 10 million years of its first appearance, although some species, called living fossils, survive with little to no morphological change for hundreds of millions of years.\nMass extinctions are relatively rare events; however, isolated extinctions of species and clades are quite common, and are a natural part of the evolutionary process. Only recently have extinctions begun to be recorded, and there is an ongoing mass extinction event caused by human activity. Most species that become extinct are never scientifically documented. Some scientists estimate that up to half of presently existing plant and animal species may become extinct by 2100. A 2018 report indicated that the phylogenetic diversity of 300 mammalian species erased during the human era since the Late Pleistocene would require 5 to 7 million years to recover.\nAccording to the 2019 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services by IPBES, the biomass of wild mammals has fallen by 82%, natural ecosystems have lost about half their area and a million species are at risk of extinction\u2014all largely as a result of human actions. Twenty-five percent of plant and animal species are threatened with extinction. In a subsequent report, IPBES listed unsustainable fishing, hunting and logging as being some of the primary drivers of the global extinction crisis.  In June 2019, one million species of plants and animals were at risk of extinction. At least 571 plant species have been lost since 1750. The main cause of the extinctions is the destruction of natural habitats by human activities, such as cutting down forests and converting land into fields for farming.\nA dagger symbol (\u2020) placed next to the name of a species or other taxon normally indicates its status as extinct.\n\n\n## Definition\n\n\nA species is extinct when the last existing member dies. Extinction therefore becomes a certainty when there are no surviving individuals that can reproduce and create a new generation. A species may become functionally extinct when only a handful of individuals survive, which cannot reproduce due to poor health, age, sparse distribution over a large range, a lack of individuals of both sexes (in sexually reproducing species), or other reasons.\nPinpointing the extinction (or pseudoextinction) of a species requires a clear definition of that species. If it is to be declared extinct, the species in question must be uniquely distinguishable from any ancestor or daughter species, and from any other closely related species. Extinction of a species (or replacement by a daughter species) plays a key role in the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis of Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge.\n\nIn ecology, extinction is sometimes used informally to refer to local extinction, in which a species ceases to exist in the chosen area of study, despite still existing elsewhere. Local extinctions may be made good by the reintroduction of individuals of that species taken from other locations; wolf reintroduction is an example of this. Species that are not globally extinct are termed extant. Those species that are extant, yet are threatened with extinction, are referred to as threatened or endangered species.\n\nCurrently, an important aspect of extinction is human attempts to preserve critically endangered species. These are reflected by the creation of the conservation status \"extinct in the wild\" (EW). Species listed under this status by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) are not known to have any living specimens in the wild and are maintained only in zoos or other artificial environments. Some of these species are functionally extinct, as they are no longer part of their natural habitat and it is unlikely the species will ever be restored to the wild. When possible, modern zoological institutions try to maintain a viable population for species preservation and possible future reintroduction to the wild, through use of carefully planned breeding programs.\nThe extinction of one species' wild population can have knock-on effects, causing further extinctions. These are also called \"chains of extinction\". This is especially common with extinction of keystone species.\nA 2018 study indicated that the sixth mass extinction started in the Late Pleistocene could take up to 5 to 7 million years to restore mammal diversity to what it was before the human era.\n\n\n### Pseudoextinction\n\nExtinction of a parent species where daughter species or subspecies are still extant is called pseudoextinction or phyletic extinction. Effectively, the old taxon vanishes, transformed (anagenesis) into a successor, or split into more than one (cladogenesis).\nPseudoextinction is difficult to demonstrate unless one has a strong chain of evidence linking a living species to members of a pre-existing species. For example, it is sometimes claimed that the extinct Hyracotherium, which was an early horse that shares a common ancestor with the modern horse, is pseudoextinct, rather than extinct, because there are several extant species of Equus, including zebra and donkey; however, as fossil species typically leave no genetic material behind, one cannot say whether Hyracotherium evolved into more modern horse species or merely evolved from a common ancestor with modern horses. Pseudoextinction is much easier to demonstrate for larger taxonomic groups.\n\n\n### Lazarus taxa\n\nA Lazarus taxon or Lazarus species refers to instances where a species or taxon was thought to be extinct, but was later rediscovered. It can also refer to instances where large gaps in the fossil record of a taxon result in fossils reappearing much later, although the taxon may have ultimately become extinct at a later point.\nThe coelacanth, a fish related to lungfish and tetrapods, is an example of a Lazarus taxon that was known only from the fossil record and was considered to have been extinct since the end of the Cretaceous Period. In 1938, however, a living specimen was found off the Chalumna River (now Tyolomnqa) on the east coast of South Africa. Calliostoma bullatum, a species of deepwater sea snail originally described from fossils in 1844 proved to be a Lazarus species when extant individuals were described in 2019.\nAttenborough's long-beaked echidna (Zaglossus attenboroughi) is an example of a Lazarus species from Papua New Guinea that had last been sighted in 1962 and believed to be possibly extinct, until it was recorded again in November 2023.\nSome species thought to be extinct have had ongoing speculation that they may still exist, and in the event of rediscovery would be considered Lazarus species. Examples include the thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger (Thylacinus cynocephalus), the last known example of which died in Hobart Zoo in Tasmania in 1936; the Japanese wolf (Canis lupus hodophilax), last sighted over 100 years ago; the American ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), with the last universally accepted sighting in 1944; and the slender-billed curlew (Numenius tenuirostris), not seen since 2007.\n\n\n## Causes\n\n\nAs long as species have been evolving, species have been going extinct. It is estimated that over 99.9% of all species that ever lived are extinct. The average lifespan of a species is 1\u201310 million years, although this varies widely between taxa.\nA variety of causes can contribute directly or indirectly to the extinction of a species or group of species. \"Just as each species is unique\", write Beverly and Stephen C. Stearns, \"so is each extinction ... the causes for each are varied\u2014some subtle and complex, others obvious and simple\". Most simply, any species that cannot survive and reproduce in its environment and cannot move to a new environment where it can do so, dies out and becomes extinct. Extinction of a species may come suddenly when an otherwise healthy species is wiped out completely, as when toxic pollution renders its entire habitat unliveable; or may occur gradually over thousands or millions of years, such as when a species gradually loses out in competition for food to better adapted competitors. Extinction may occur a long time after the events that set it in motion, a phenomenon known as extinction debt.\nAssessing the relative importance of genetic factors compared to environmental ones as the causes of extinction has been compared to the debate on nature and nurture. The question of whether more extinctions in the fossil record have been caused by evolution or by competition or by predation or by disease or by catastrophe is a subject of discussion; Mark Newman, the author of Modeling Extinction, argues for a mathematical model that falls in all positions. By contrast, conservation biology uses the extinction vortex model to classify extinctions by cause. When concerns about human extinction have been raised, for example in Sir Martin Rees' 2003 book Our Final Hour, those concerns lie with the effects of climate change or technological disaster.\nHuman-driven extinction started as humans migrated out of Africa more than 60,000 years ago. Currently, environmental groups and some governments are concerned with the extinction of species caused by humanity, and they try to prevent further extinctions through a variety of conservation programs. Humans can cause extinction of a species through overharvesting, pollution, habitat destruction, introduction of invasive species (such as new predators and food competitors), overhunting, and other influences. Explosive, unsustainable human population growth and increasing per capita consumption are essential drivers of the extinction crisis. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), 784 extinctions have been recorded since the year 1500, the arbitrary date selected to define \"recent\" extinctions, up to the year 2004; with many more likely to have gone unnoticed. Several species have also been listed as extinct since 2004.\n\n\n### Genetics and demographic phenomena\n\nIf adaptation increasing population fitness is slower than environmental degradation plus the accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations, then a population will go extinct. Smaller populations have fewer beneficial mutations entering the population each generation, slowing adaptation. It is also easier for slightly deleterious mutations to fix in small populations; the resulting positive feedback loop between small population size and low fitness can cause mutational meltdown.\nLimited geographic range is the most important determinant of genus extinction at background rates but becomes increasingly irrelevant as mass extinction arises. Limited geographic range is a cause both of small population size and of greater vulnerability to local environmental catastrophes.\nExtinction rates can be affected not just by population size, but by any factor that affects evolvability, including balancing selection, cryptic genetic variation, phenotypic plasticity, and robustness. A diverse or deep gene pool gives a population a higher chance in the short term of surviving an adverse change in conditions. Effects that cause or reward a loss in genetic diversity can increase the chances of extinction of a species. Population bottlenecks can dramatically reduce genetic diversity by severely limiting the number of reproducing individuals and make inbreeding more frequent.\n\n\n### Genetic pollution\n\nExtinction sometimes results for species evolved to specific ecologies that are subjected to genetic pollution\u2014i.e., uncontrolled hybridization, introgression and genetic swamping that lead to homogenization or out-competition from the introduced (or hybrid) species. Endemic populations can face such extinctions when new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact. Extinction is likeliest for rare species coming into contact with more abundant ones; interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool (for example, the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the abundant domestic water buffalo). Such extinctions are not always apparent from morphological (non-genetic) observations. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionary process; nevertheless, hybridization (with or without introgression) threatens rare species' existence.\nThe gene pool of a species or a population is the variety of genetic information in its living members. A large gene pool (extensive genetic diversity) is associated with robust populations that can survive bouts of intense selection. Meanwhile, low genetic diversity (see inbreeding and population bottlenecks) reduces the range of adaptions possible. Replacing native with alien genes narrows genetic diversity within the original population, thereby increasing the chance of extinction.\n\n\n### Habitat degradation\n\nHabitat degradation is currently the main anthropogenic cause of species extinctions. The main cause of habitat degradation worldwide is agriculture, with urban sprawl, logging, mining, and some fishing practices close behind. The degradation of a species' habitat may alter the fitness landscape to such an extent that the species is no longer able to survive and becomes extinct. This may occur by direct effects, such as the environment becoming toxic, or indirectly, by limiting a species' ability to compete effectively for diminished resources or against new competitor species.\nHabitat destruction, particularly the removal of vegetation that stabilizes soil, enhances erosion and diminishes nutrient availability in terrestrial ecosystems. This degradation can lead to a reduction in agricultural productivity. Furthermore, increased erosion contributes to poorer water quality by elevating the levels of sediment and pollutants in rivers and streams.\nHabitat degradation through toxicity can kill off a species very rapidly, by killing all living members through contamination or sterilizing them. It can also occur over longer periods at lower toxicity levels by affecting life span, reproductive capacity, or competitiveness.\nHabitat degradation can also take the form of a physical destruction of niche habitats. The widespread destruction of tropical rainforests and replacement with open pastureland is widely cited as an example of this; elimination of the dense forest eliminated the infrastructure needed by many species to survive. For example, a fern that depends on dense shade for protection from direct sunlight can no longer survive without forest to shelter it. Another example is the destruction of ocean floors by bottom trawling.\nDiminished resources or introduction of new competitor species also often accompany habitat degradation. Global warming has allowed some species to expand their range, bringing competition to other species that previously occupied that area. Sometimes these new competitors are predators and directly affect prey species, while at other times they may merely outcompete vulnerable species for limited resources. Vital resources including water and food can also be limited during habitat degradation, leading to extinction.\n\n\n### Predation, competition, and disease\n\nIn the natural course of events, species become extinct for a number of reasons, including but not limited to: extinction of a necessary host, prey or pollinator, interspecific competition, inability to deal with evolving diseases and changing environmental conditions (particularly sudden changes) which can act to introduce novel predators, or to remove prey. Recently in geological time, humans have become an additional cause of extinction of some species, either as a new mega-predator or by transporting animals and plants from one part of the world to another. Such introductions have been occurring for thousands of years, sometimes intentionally (e.g. livestock released by sailors on islands as a future source of food) and sometimes accidentally (e.g. rats escaping from boats). In most cases, the introductions are unsuccessful, but when an invasive alien species does become established, the consequences can be catastrophic. Invasive alien species can affect native species directly by eating them, competing with them, and introducing pathogens or parasites that sicken or kill them; or indirectly by destroying or degrading their habitat. Human populations may themselves act as invasive predators. According to the \"overkill hypothesis\", the swift extinction of the megafauna in areas such as Australia (40,000 years before present), North and South America (12,000 years before present), Madagascar, Hawaii (AD 300\u20131000), and New Zealand (AD 1300\u20131500), resulted from the sudden introduction of human beings to environments full of animals that had never seen them before and were therefore completely unadapted to their predation techniques.\n\n\n### Coextinction\n\nCoextinction refers to the loss of a species due to the extinction of another; for example, the extinction of parasitic insects following the loss of their hosts. Coextinction can also occur when a species loses its pollinator, or to predators in a food chain who lose their prey. \"Species coextinction is a manifestation of one of the interconnectednesses of organisms in complex ecosystems ... While coextinction may not be the most important cause of species extinctions, it is certainly an insidious one.\" Coextinction is especially common when a keystone species goes extinct. Models suggest that coextinction is the most common form of biodiversity loss. There may be a cascade of coextinction across the trophic levels. Such effects are most severe in mutualistic and parasitic relationships. An example of coextinction is the Haast's eagle and the moa: the Haast's eagle was a predator that became extinct because its food source became extinct. The moa were several species of flightless birds that were a food source for the Haast's eagle.\n\n\n### Climate change\n\nExtinction as a result of climate change has been confirmed by fossil studies. Particularly, the extinction of amphibians during the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, 305 million years ago. A 2003 review across 14 biodiversity research centers predicted that, because of climate change, 15\u201337% of land species would be \"committed to extinction\" by 2050. The ecologically rich areas that would potentially suffer the heaviest losses include the Cape Floristic Region and the Caribbean Basin. These areas might see a doubling of present carbon dioxide levels and rising temperatures that could eliminate 56,000 plant and 3,700 animal species. Climate change has also been found to be a factor in habitat loss and desertification.\n\n\n### Sexual selection and male investment\nStudies of fossils following species from the time they evolved to their extinction show that species with high sexual dimorphism, especially characteristics in males that are used to compete for mating, are at a higher risk of extinction and die out faster than less sexually dimorphic species, the least sexually dimorphic species surviving for millions of years while the most sexually dimorphic species die out within mere thousands of years. Earlier studies based on counting the number of currently living species in modern taxa have shown a higher number of species in more sexually dimorphic taxa which have been interpreted as higher survival in taxa with more sexual selection, but such studies of modern species only measure indirect effects of extinction and are subject to error sources such as dying and doomed taxa speciating more due to splitting of habitat ranges into more small isolated groups during the habitat retreat of taxa approaching extinction. Possible causes of the higher extinction risk in species with more sexual selection shown by the comprehensive fossil studies that rule out such error sources include expensive sexually selected ornaments having negative effects on the ability to survive natural selection, as well as sexual selection removing a diversity of genes that under current ecological conditions are neutral for natural selection but some of which may be important for surviving climate change.\n\n\n## Mass extinctions\n\n\nThere have been at least five mass extinctions in the history of life on earth, and four in the last 350 million years in which many species have disappeared in a relatively short period of geological time. A massive eruptive event that released large quantities of tephra particles into the atmosphere is considered to be one likely cause of the \"Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event\" about 250 million years ago, which is estimated to have killed 90% of species then existing. There is also evidence to suggest that this event was preceded by another mass extinction, known as Olson's Extinction. The Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event (K\u2013Pg) occurred 66 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period; it is best known for having wiped out non-avian dinosaurs, among many other species.\n\n\n### Modern extinctions\n\nAccording to a 1998 survey of 400 biologists conducted by New York's American Museum of Natural History, nearly 70% believed that the Earth is currently in the early stages of a human-caused mass extinction, known as the Holocene extinction. In that survey, the same proportion of respondents agreed with the prediction that up to 20% of all living populations could become extinct within 30 years (by 2028). A 2014 special edition of Science declared there is widespread consensus on the issue of human-driven mass species extinctions.  A 2020 study published in PNAS stated that the contemporary extinction crisis \"may be the most serious environmental threat to the persistence of civilization, because it is irreversible.\" A 2025 study found that human activities are to blame for biodiversity loss across all species and ecosystems.\nBiologist E. O. Wilson estimated in 2002 that if current rates of human destruction of the biosphere continue, one-half of all plant and animal species of life on earth will be extinct in 100 years. More significantly, the current rate of global species extinctions is estimated as 100 to 1,000 times \"background\" rates (the average extinction rates in the evolutionary time scale of planet Earth), faster than at any other time in human history, while future rates are likely 10,000 times higher. However, some groups are going extinct much faster. Biologists Paul R. Ehrlich and Stuart Pimm, among others, contend that human population growth and overconsumption are the main drivers of the modern extinction crisis.\nIn January 2020, the UN's Convention on Biological Diversity drafted a plan to mitigate the contemporary extinction crisis by establishing a deadline of 2030 to protect 30% of the Earth's land and oceans and reduce pollution by 50%, with the goal of allowing for the restoration of ecosystems by 2050. The 2020 United Nations' Global Biodiversity Outlook report stated that of the 20 biodiversity goals laid out by the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in 2010, only 6 were \"partially achieved\" by the deadline of 2020. The report warned that biodiversity will continue to decline if the status quo is not changed, in particular the \"currently unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, population growth and technological developments\". In a 2021 report published in the journal Frontiers in Conservation Science, some top scientists asserted that even if the Aichi Biodiversity Targets set for 2020 had been achieved, it would not have resulted in a significant mitigation of biodiversity loss. They added that failure of the global community to reach these targets is hardly surprising given that biodiversity loss is \"nowhere close to the top of any country's priorities, trailing far behind other concerns such as employment, healthcare, economic growth, or currency stability.\"\n\n\n## History of scientific understanding\n\n\nFor much of history, the modern understanding of extinction as the end of a species was incompatible with the prevailing worldview. Prior to the 19th century, much of Western society adhered to the belief that the world was created by God and as such was complete and perfect. This concept reached its heyday in the 1700s with the peak popularity of a theological concept called the great chain of being, in which all life on earth, from the tiniest microorganism to God, is linked in a continuous chain. The extinction of a species was impossible under this model, as it would create gaps or missing links in the chain and destroy the natural order. Thomas Jefferson was a firm supporter of the great chain of being and an opponent of extinction, famously denying the extinction of the woolly mammoth on the grounds that nature never allows a race of animals to become extinct.\nA series of fossils were discovered in the late 17th century that appeared unlike any living species. As a result, the scientific community embarked on a voyage of creative rationalization, seeking to understand what had happened to these species within a framework that did not account for total extinction. In October 1686, Robert Hooke presented an impression of a nautilus to the Royal Society that was more than two feet in diameter, and morphologically distinct from any known living species. Hooke theorized that this was simply because the species lived in the deep ocean and no one had discovered them yet. While he contended that it was possible a species could be \"lost\", he thought this highly unlikely. Similarly, in 1695, Sir Thomas Molyneux published an account of enormous antlers found in Ireland that did not belong to any extant taxa in that area. Molyneux reasoned that they came from the North American moose and that the animal had once been common on the British Isles. Rather than suggest that this indicated the possibility of species going extinct, he argued that although organisms could become locally extinct, they could never be entirely lost and would continue to exist in some unknown region of the globe. The antlers were later confirmed to be from the extinct deer Megaloceros. Hooke and Molyneux's line of thinking was difficult to disprove. When parts of the world had not been thoroughly examined and charted, scientists could not rule out that animals found only in the fossil record were not simply \"hiding\" in unexplored regions of the Earth.\nGeorges Cuvier is credited with establishing the modern conception of extinction in a 1796 lecture to the French Institute, though he would spend most of his career trying to convince the wider scientific community of his theory. Cuvier was a well-regarded geologist, lauded for his ability to reconstruct the anatomy of an unknown species from a few fragments of bone. His primary evidence for extinction came from mammoth skulls found near Paris. Cuvier recognized them as distinct from any known living species of elephant, and argued that it was highly unlikely such an enormous animal would go undiscovered. In 1798, he studied a fossil from the Paris Basin that was first observed by Robert de Lamanon in 1782, first hypothesizing that it belonged to a canine but then deciding that it instead belonged to an animal that was unlike living ones. His study paved the way to his naming of the extinct mammal genus Palaeotherium in 1804 based on the skull and additional fossil material along with another extinct contemporary mammal genus Anoplotherium. In both genera, he noticed that their fossils shared some similarities with other mammals like ruminants and rhinoceroses but still had distinct differences. In 1812, Cuvier, along with Alexandre Brongniart and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, mapped the strata of the Paris basin. They saw alternating saltwater and freshwater deposits, as well as patterns of the appearance and disappearance of fossils throughout the record. From these patterns, Cuvier inferred historic cycles of catastrophic flooding, extinction, and repopulation of the earth with new species.\nCuvier's fossil evidence showed that very different life forms existed in the past than those that exist today, a fact that was accepted by most scientists. The primary debate focused on whether this turnover caused by extinction was gradual or abrupt in nature. Cuvier understood extinction to be the result of cataclysmic events that wipe out huge numbers of species, as opposed to the gradual decline of a species over time. His catastrophic view of the nature of extinction garnered him many opponents in the newly emerging school of uniformitarianism.\nJean-Baptiste Lamarck, a gradualist and colleague of Cuvier, saw the fossils of different life forms as evidence of the mutable character of species. While Lamarck did not deny the possibility of extinction, he believed that it was exceptional and rare and that most of the change in species over time was due to gradual change. Unlike Cuvier, Lamarck was skeptical that catastrophic events of a scale large enough to cause total extinction were possible. In his geological history of the earth titled Hydrogeologie, Lamarck instead argued that the surface of the earth was shaped by gradual erosion and deposition by water, and that species changed over time in response to the changing environment.\nCharles Lyell, a noted geologist and founder of uniformitarianism, believed that past processes should be understood using present day processes. Like Lamarck, Lyell acknowledged that extinction could occur, noting the total extinction of the dodo and the extirpation of indigenous horses to the British Isles. He similarly argued against mass extinctions, believing that any extinction must be a gradual process. Lyell also showed that Cuvier's original interpretation of the Parisian strata was incorrect. Instead of the catastrophic floods inferred by Cuvier, Lyell demonstrated that patterns of saltwater and freshwater deposits, like those seen in the Paris basin, could be formed by a slow rise and fall of sea levels.\nThe concept of extinction was integral to Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, with less fit lineages disappearing over time. For Darwin, extinction was a constant side effect of competition. Because of the wide reach of On the Origin of Species, it was widely accepted that extinction occurred gradually and evenly (a concept now referred to as background extinction). It was not until 1982, when David Raup and Jack Sepkoski published their seminal paper on mass extinctions, that Cuvier was vindicated and catastrophic extinction was accepted as an important mechanism. The current understanding of extinction is a synthesis of the cataclysmic extinction events proposed by Cuvier, and the background extinction events proposed by Lyell and Darwin.\n\n\n## Human attitudes and interests\n\n\nExtinction is an important research topic in the field of zoology, and biology in general, and has also become an area of concern outside the scientific community. A number of organizations, such as the Worldwide Fund for Nature, have been created with the goal of preserving species from extinction. Governments have attempted, through enacting laws, to avoid habitat destruction, agricultural over-harvesting, and pollution. While many human-caused extinctions have been accidental, humans have also engaged in the deliberate destruction of some species, such as dangerous viruses, and the total destruction of other problematic species has been suggested. Other species were deliberately driven to extinction, or nearly so, due to poaching or because they were \"undesirable\", or to push for other human agendas. One example was the near extinction of the American bison, which was nearly wiped out by mass hunts sanctioned by the United States government, to force the removal of Native Americans, many of whom relied on the bison for food.\nBiologist Bruce Walsh states three reasons for scientific interest in the preservation of species: genetic resources, ecosystem stability, and ethics; and today the scientific community \"stress[es] the importance\" of maintaining biodiversity.\nIn modern times, commercial and industrial interests often have to contend with the effects of production on plant and animal life. However, some technologies with minimal, or no, proven harmful effects on Homo sapiens can be devastating to wildlife (for example, DDT). Biogeographer Jared Diamond notes that while big business may label environmental concerns as \"exaggerated\", and often cause \"devastating damage\", some corporations find it in their interest to adopt good conservation practices, and even engage in preservation efforts that surpass those taken by national parks.\nGovernments sometimes see the loss of native species as a loss to ecotourism, and can enact laws with severe punishment against the trade in native species in an effort to prevent extinction in the wild. Nature preserves are created by governments as a means to provide continuing habitats to species crowded by human expansion. The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity has resulted in international Biodiversity Action Plan programmes, which attempt to provide comprehensive guidelines for government biodiversity conservation. Advocacy groups, such as The Wildlands Project and the Alliance for Zero Extinctions, work to educate the public and pressure governments into action.\nPeople who live close to nature can be dependent on the survival of all the species in their environment, leaving them highly exposed to extinction risks. However, people prioritize day-to-day survival over species conservation; with human overpopulation in tropical developing countries, there has been enormous pressure on forests due to subsistence agriculture, including slash-and-burn agricultural techniques that can reduce endangered species's habitats.\nAntinatalist philosopher David Benatar concludes that any popular concern about non-human species extinction usually arises out of concern about how the loss of a species will impact human wants and needs, that \"we shall live in a world impoverished by the loss of one aspect of faunal diversity, that we shall no longer be able to behold or use that species of animal.\" He notes that typical concerns about possible human extinction, such as the loss of individual members, are not considered in regards to non-human species extinction. Anthropologist Jason Hickel speculates that the reason humanity seems largely indifferent to anthropogenic mass species extinction is that we see ourselves as separate from the natural world and the organisms within it. He says that this is due in part to the logic of capitalism: \"that the world is not really alive, and it is certainly not our kin, but rather just stuff to be extracted and discarded \u2013 and that includes most of the human beings living here too.\"\n\n\n### Planned extinction\n\n\n=### Completed=\nThe smallpox virus is now extinct in the wild, although samples are retained in laboratory settings.\nThe rinderpest virus, which infected domestic cattle, is now extinct in the wild.\n\n\n=### Proposed=\n\n\n==### Disease agents==\nThe poliovirus is now confined to small parts of the world due to extermination efforts.\nDracunculus medinensis, or Guinea worm, a parasitic worm which causes the disease dracunculiasis, is now close to eradication thanks to efforts led by the Carter Center.\nTreponema pallidum pertenue, a bacterium which causes the disease yaws, is in the process of being eradicated.\n\n\n==### Disease vectors==\nBiologist Olivia Judson has advocated the deliberate extinction of certain disease-carrying mosquito species. In an article in The New York Times on 25 September 2003, she advocated \"specicide\" of thirty mosquito species by introducing a genetic element that can insert itself into another crucial gene, to create recessive \"knockout genes\". She says that the Anopheles mosquitoes (which spread malaria) and Aedes mosquitoes (which spread dengue fever, yellow fever, elephantiasis, and other diseases) represent only 30 of around 3,500 mosquito species; eradicating these would save at least one million human lives per year, at a cost of reducing the genetic diversity of the family Culicidae by only 1%. She further argues that since species become extinct \"all the time\" the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the ecosystem: \"We're not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes. Removing one species sometimes causes shifts in the populations of other species\u2014but different need not mean worse.\" In addition, anti-malarial and mosquito control programs offer little realistic hope to the 300 million people in developing nations who will be infected with acute illnesses this year. Although trials are ongoing, she writes that if they fail \"we should consider the ultimate swatting\".\nBiologist E. O. Wilson has advocated the eradication of several species of mosquito, including malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. Wilson stated, \"I'm talking about a very small number of species that have co-evolved with us and are preying on humans, so it would certainly be acceptable to remove them. I believe it's just common sense.\"\nThere have been many campaigns \u2013 some successful \u2013 to locally eradicate tsetse flies and their trypanosomes in areas, countries, and islands of Africa (including Pr\u00edncipe). There are currently serious efforts to do away with them all across Africa, and this is generally viewed as beneficial and morally necessary, although not always.\n\n\n### Cloning\n\nSome, such as Harvard geneticist George M. Church, believe that ongoing technological advances will let us \"bring back to life\" an extinct species by cloning, using DNA from the remains of that species. Proposed targets for cloning include the mammoth, the thylacine, and the Pyrenean ibex. For this to succeed, enough individuals would have to be cloned, from the DNA of different individuals (in the case of sexually reproducing organisms) to create a viable population. Though bioethical and philosophical objections have been raised, the cloning of extinct creatures seems theoretically possible.\nIn 2003, scientists tried to clone the extinct Pyrenean ibex (C. p. pyrenaica). This attempt failed: of the 285 embryos reconstructed, 54 were transferred to 12 Spanish ibexes and ibex\u2013domestic goat hybrids, but only two survived the initial two months of gestation before they, too, died. In 2009, a second attempt was made to clone the Pyrenean ibex: one clone was born alive, but died seven minutes later, due to physical defects in the lungs.\n\n\n## See also\n\n\n\n## References\n\n\n\n## Further reading\n\nDay, David (1981).

      "text": "# Extinction_(psychology)\n\nExtinction is a behavioral phenomenon observed in both operantly conditioned and classically conditioned behavior, which manifests itself by fading of non-reinforced conditioned response over time. When operant behavior that has been previously reinforced no longer produces reinforcing consequences, the behavior gradually returns to operant levels (to the frequency of the behavior previous to learning, which may or may not be zero). \nIn classical conditioning, when a conditioned stimulus is presented alone, so that it no longer predicts the coming of the unconditioned stimulus, conditioned responding gradually stops. For example, after Pavlov's dog was conditioned to salivate at the sound of a metronome, it eventually stopped salivating to the metronome after the metronome had been sounded repeatedly but no food came. \nMany anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder are believed to reflect, at least in part, a failure to extinguish conditioned fear.\n\n\n## Theories\n\nAs of 2025 a view was that extinction learning did not replace the original fear memory, but rather created a new \u2018safety memory\u2019 that inhibited the fear response. The safety response was hoped to be dominant over the fear memory.\nPreviously the dominant account of extinction involved associative models, but with debate over whether extinction involved simply \"unlearning\" the unconditional stimulus (US) \u2013 Conditional stimulus (CS) association (e.g., the Rescorla\u2013Wagner account) or, alternatively, a \"new learning\" of an inhibitory association that masked the original excitatory association (e.g., Konorski, Pearce and Hall account). A third account concerned non-associative mechanisms such as habituation, modulation and response fatigue. Myers & Davis reviewed fear extinction in rodents and suggested that multiple mechanisms may be at work depending on the timing and circumstances in which the extinction occurs.\nGiven the competing views and difficult observations for the various accounts researchers had turned to investigations at the cellular level (most often in rodents) to tease apart the specific brain mechanisms of extinction, in particular the role of the brain structures (amygdala, hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex), and specific neurotransmitter systems (e.g., GABA, NMDA). A study in rodents by Amano, Unal and Par\u00e9 published in Nature Neuroscience found that extinction of a conditioned fear response was correlated with synaptic inhibition in the fear output neurons of the central amygdala that project to the periaqueductal gray that controls freezing behavior. They infer that inhibition derives from the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and suggest promising targets at the cellular level for new treatments of anxiety.\n\n\n## Classical conditioning\n\nLearning extinction can also occur in a classical conditioning paradigm. In this model, a neutral cue or context can come to elicit a conditioned response when it is paired with an unconditioned stimulus. An unconditioned stimulus is one that naturally and automatically triggers a certain behavioral response. A certain stimulus or environment can become a conditioned cue or a conditioned context, respectively, when paired with an unconditioned stimulus. An example of this process is a fear conditioning paradigm using a mouse. In this instance, a tone paired with a mild footshock can become a conditioned cue, eliciting a fear response when presented alone in the future. In the same way, the context in which a footshock is received such as a chamber with certain dimensions and a certain odor can elicit the same fear response when the mouse is placed back in that chamber in the absence of the footshock.\nIn this paradigm, extinction occurs when the animal is re-exposed to the conditioned cue or conditioned context in the absence of the unconditioned stimulus. As the animal learns that the cue or context no longer predicts the coming of the unconditioned stimulus, conditioned responding gradually decreases, or extinguishes.\n\n\n## Operant conditioning\n\nIn the operant conditioning paradigm, extinction refers to the process of no longer providing the reinforcement that has been maintaining a behavior. Operant extinction  differs from forgetting in that the latter refers to a decrease in the strength of a behavior over time when it has not been emitted. For example, a child who climbs under his desk, a response which has been reinforced by attention, is subsequently ignored until the attention-seeking behavior no longer occurs. In his autobiography, B. F. Skinner noted how he accidentally discovered the extinction of an operant response due to the malfunction of his laboratory equipment:\n\nMy first extinction curve showed up by accident. A rat was pressing the lever in an experiment on satiation when the pellet dispenser jammed. I was not there at the time, and when I returned I found a beautiful curve. The rat had gone on pressing although no pellets were received. ... The change was more orderly than the extinction of a salivary reflex in Pavlov's setting, and I was terribly excited. It was a Friday afternoon and there was no one in the laboratory whom I could tell. All that weekend I crossed streets with particular care and avoided all unnecessary risks to protect my discovery from loss through my accidental death.\nWhen the extinction of a response has occurred, the discriminative stimulus is then known as an extinction stimulus (S\u0394 or S-delta). When an S-delta is present, the reinforcing consequence which characteristically follows a behavior does not occur. This is the opposite of a discriminative stimulus, which is a signal that reinforcement will occur. For instance, in an operant conditioning chamber, if food pellets are only delivered when a response is emitted in the presence of a green light, the green light is a discriminative stimulus. If when a red light is present. food will not be delivered, then the red light is an extinction stimulus. (Food is used here as an example of a reinforcer.) However, some make the distinction between extinction stimuli and \"S-Delta\" due to the behavior not having a reinforcement history, i.e. in an array of three items (phone, pen, paper) \"Which one is the phone\" the \"pen\" and \"paper\" will not produce a response in the teacher, but is not technically extinction on the first trial due to selecting \"pen\" or \"paper\", missing a reinforcement history. This still would be considered as S-Delta.\n\n\n## Successful extinction procedures\n\nIn order for extinction to work effectively, it must be done consistently. Extinction is considered successful when responding in the presence of an extinction stimulus (a red light or a teacher not giving a bad student attention, for instance) is zero. When a behavior reappears again after it has gone through extinction, it is called spontaneous recovery. It (extinction) is the result of challenging behavior(s) no longer occurring without the need for reinforcement. If there is a relapse and reinforcements are given, the problem behavior will return. Extinction can be a long process; therefore, it requires that the facilitator of the procedure be completely invested from beginning to end in order for the outcome to be successful. The fewer challenging behaviors observed after extinction will most likely produce a less significant spontaneous recovery. While working towards extinction there are different distributions or schedules of when to administer reinforcements. Some people may use an intermittent reinforcement schedule that include: fixed ratio, variable ratio, fixed interval and variable interval. Another option is to use a continuous reinforcement. Schedules can be both fixed and variable and also the number of reinforcements given during each interval can vary.\n\n\n### Extinction procedures in the classroom\nA positive classroom environment wields better results in learning growth. Therefore, in order for children to be successful in the classroom, their environment should be free of problem behaviors that can cause distractions. The classroom should be a place that offers consistency, structure, and stability, where the student feels empowered, supported and safe. When problem behaviors occur, learning opportunities decrease. Problem behaviors in the classroom that would benefit from extinction may include off-task behaviors, blurting, yelling, interrupting and use of inappropriate language. The use of extinction has been used primarily when the problem behaviors interfered with successful classroom outcomes. While other methods have been used in conjunction with extinction, positive outcomes are not likely when extinction is not used in behavior interventions.\n\n\n### Burst\nWhile extinction, when implemented consistently over time, results in the eventual decrease of the undesired behavior, in the short term the subject might exhibit what is called an extinction burst. An extinction burst will often occur when the extinction procedure has just begun. This usually consists of a sudden and temporary increase in the response's frequency, followed by the eventual decline and extinction of the behavior targeted for elimination. Novel behavior, or emotional responses or aggressive behavior, may also occur.\nFor example, a pigeon has been reinforced to peck an electronic button. During its training history, every time the pigeon pecked the button, it will have received a small amount of bird seed as a reinforcer. Thus, whenever the bird is hungry, it will peck the button to receive food. However, if the button were to be turned off, the hungry pigeon will first try pecking the button just as it has in the past. When no food is forthcoming, the bird will likely try repeatedly. After a period of frantic activity, in which their pecking behavior yields no result, the pigeon's pecking will decrease in frequency.\nAlthough not explained by reinforcement theory, the extinction burst can be understood using control theory. In perceptual control theory, the degree of output involved in any action is proportional to the discrepancy between the reference value (desired rate of reward in the operant paradigm) and the current input. Thus, when reward is removed, the discrepancy increases, and the output is increased. In the long term, 'reorganisation', the learning algorithm of control theory, would adapt the control system such that output is reduced.\nThe evolutionary advantage of this extinction burst is clear. In a natural environment, an animal that persists in a learned behavior, despite not resulting in immediate reinforcement, might still have a chance of producing reinforcing consequences if the animal tries again. This animal would be at an advantage over another animal that gives up too easily.\nDespite the name, however, not every explosive reaction to adverse stimuli subsides to extinction. Indeed, a small minority of individuals persist in their reaction indefinitely.\n\n\n### Extinction-induced variability\nExtinction-induced variability serves an adaptive role similar to the extinction burst. When extinction begins, subjects can exhibit variations in response topography (the movements involved in the response). Response topography is always somewhat variable due to differences in environment or idiosyncratic causes but normally a subject's history of reinforcement keeps slight variations stable by maintaining successful variations over less successful variations. Extinction can increase these variations significantly as the subject attempts to acquire the reinforcement that previous behaviors produced. If a person attempts to open a door by turning the knob, but is unsuccessful, they may next try jiggling the knob, pushing on the frame, knocking on the door or other behaviors to get the door to open. Extinction-induced variability can be used in shaping to reduce problematic behaviors by reinforcing desirable behaviors produced by extinction-induced variability.\n\n\n## Autism\n\n\nChildren with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are known to have restricted or repetitive behaviors that can cause problems when trying to function in day-to-day activities. Extinction is used as an intervention to help with problem behaviors. Some problem behaviors may include but are not limited to, self-injurious behaviors, aggression, tantrums, problems with sleep, and making choices. Ignoring certain self-injurious behaviors can lead to the extinction of said behaviors in children with ASD. Escape Extinction (EE) is commonly used in instances when having to make choices causes problem behavior. An example could be having to choose between mint or strawberry flavored toothpaste when brushing your teeth. Those would be the only two options available. When implementing EE, the interventionist will use physical and verbal prompting to help the subject make a choice.\n\n\n## Anxiety\n\nFear extinction is the fundamental principle behind exposure therapy, a common treatment for anxiety disorders. In this process, the conditioned fear responses diminish progressively over time, when the previously conditioned stimulus is presented without being paired with the unconditioned stimulus.\nTo understand the brain changes during this, a task-functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) can be performed. Moreover, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) can be used to quantify endogenous dopamine release. Dopamine antagonists like [11C] raclopride and [18F] fallypride can be used to study D2/D3 dopamine receptor binding potential in the brain. [11C] Raclopride is popular in studies focusing on striatal dopamine activity and ease of use considering a shorter half-life (about 20 minutes). On the other hand, [18F] fallypride is best for studying extrastriatal dopamine binding potential but has a half-life of approximately 110 minutes. Additionally, simultaneous PET and fMRI allow researchers to capture both dopamine binding potential and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals during the task. Recent studies highlight the critical role of dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex regions (vmPFC), together with other areas like the anterior insula, amygdala, and hippocampus in facilitating fear extinction processes.\n\n\n## Neurobiology\n\n\n\n### Glutamate\nGlutamate is a neurotransmitter that has been extensively implicated in the neural basis of learning. D-Cycloserine (DCS) is a partial agonist for the glutamate receptor NMDA at the glycine site, and has been trialed as an adjunct to conventional exposure-based treatments based on the principle of cue extinction.\nA role for glutamate has also been identified in the extinction of a cocaine-associated environmental stimulus through testing in rats. Specifically, the metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor (mGlu5) is important for the extinction of a cocaine-associated context and a cocaine-associated cue.\n\n\n### Dopamine\nDopamine is another neurotransmitter implicated in learning extinction across both appetitive and aversive domains. Dopamine signaling has been implicated in the extinction of conditioned fear and the extinction of drug-related learning\n\n\n### Circuitry\nThe brain region most extensively implicated in learning extinction is the infralimbic cortex (IL) of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) The IL is important for the extinction of reward- and fear-associated behaviors, while the amygdala has been strongly implicated in the extinction of conditioned fear. The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) have also been identified as regions that may be associated with impaired extinction in adolescents.\n\n\n## Across development\n\nThere is a strong body of evidence to suggest that extinction alters across development. That is, learning extinction may differ during infancy, childhood, adolescence and adulthood. During infancy and childhood, learning extinction is especially persistent, which some have interpreted as erasure of the original CS-US association, but this remains contentious. In contrast, during adolescence and adulthood extinction is less persistent, which is interpreted as new learning of a CS-no US association that exists in tandem and opposition to the original CS-US memory.\n\n\n## See also\n\n",

      "text": "# Fantasy_(psychology)\n\nIn psychoanalytic theory, fantasy is a broad range of mental experiences, mediated by the faculty of imagination in the human brain, and marked by an expression of certain desires through vivid mental imagery. Fantasies are generally associated with scenarios that are impossible or unlikely to happen.\nSexual fantasies are a common type of fantasy.\n\n\n## Conscious fantasy\n\nIn everyday life, individuals often find their thoughts \"pursue a series of fantasies concerning things they wish they could do or wish they had done ... fantasies of control or of sovereign choice ... daydreams.\"\nGeorge Eman Vaillant in his study of defence mechanisms took as a central example of \"an immature defence ... fantasy \u2014 living in a 'Walter Mitty' dream world where you imagine you are successful and popular, instead of making real efforts to make friends and succeed at a job.\"\nOther researchers and theorists find that fantasy has beneficial elements \u2014 providing \"small regressions and compensatory wish fulfilments which are recuperative in effect.\" Research by Deirdre Barrett reports that people differ radically in the vividness, as well as frequency of fantasy, and that those who have the most elaborately developed fantasy life are often the people who make productive use of their imaginations in art, literature, or by being especially creative and innovative in more traditional professions.\n\n\n## Freud and fantasy\n\n\nAccording to Sigmund Freud, a fantasy is constructed around multiple, often repressed wishes, and employs disguise to mask and mark the very defensive processes by which desire is enacted. The subject's desire to maintain distance from the repressed wish and simultaneously experience it opens up a type of third person syntax allowing for multiple entry into the fantasy. Therefore, in fantasy, vision is multiplied\u2014it becomes possible to see from more than one position at the same time, to see oneself and to see oneself seeing oneself, to divide vision and dislocate subjectivity. This radical omission of the \"I\" position creates space for all those processes that depend upon such a center, including not only identification but also the field and organization of vision itself.\nFor Freud, sexuality is linked from the very beginning to an object of fantasy. However, \"the object to be rediscovered is not the lost object, but its substitute by displacement; the lost object is the object of self-preservation, of hunger, and the object one seeks to re-find in sexuality is an object displaced in relation to that first object.\" This initial scene of fantasy is created out of the frustrated infants' deflection away from the instinctual need for milk and nourishment towards a phantasmization of the mother's breast, which is in close proximity to the instinctual need. Now bodily pleasure is derived from the sucking of the mother's breast itself. The mouth that was the original source of nourishment is now the mouth that takes pleasure in its own sucking. This substitution of the breast for milk and the breast for a phantasmic scene represents a further level of mediation which is increasingly psychic. The child cannot experience the pleasure of milk without the psychic re-inscription of the scene in the mind. \"The finding of an object is in fact a re-finding of it.\" It is in the movement and constant restaging away from the instinct that desire is constituted and mobilized.\n\n\n## Freud and daydreams\n\n\nA similarly positive view of fantasy was taken by Sigmund Freud who considered fantasy (German: Fantasie) a defence mechanism. He considered that men and women \"cannot subsist on the scanty satisfaction which they can extort from reality. 'We simply cannot do without auxiliary constructions,' as Theodor Fontane once said ... [without] dwelling on imaginary wish fulfillments.\" As childhood adaptation to the reality principle developed, so too \"one species of thought activity was split off; it was kept free from reality-testing and remained subordinated to the pleasure principle alone. This activity is fantasying ... continued as day-dreaming.\" He compared such phantasising to the way a \"nature reserve preserves its original state where everything ... including what is useless and even what is noxious, can grow and proliferate there as it pleases.\"\nDaydreams for Freud were thus a valuable resource. \"These day-dreams are cathected with a large amount of interest; they are carefully cherished by the subject and usually concealed with a great deal of sensitivity ... such phantasies may be unconscious just as well as conscious.\" He considered these fantasies to include a great deal of the true constitutional essence of a personality, and that the energetic man \"is one who succeeds by his efforts in turning his wishful phantasies into reality,\" whereas the artist \"can transform his phantasies into artistic creations instead of into symptoms ... the doom of neurosis.\"\n\n\n## Klein and unconscious fantasy\n\n\nMelanie Klein extended Freud's concept of fantasy to cover the developing child's relationship to a world of internal objects. In her thought, this kind of \"play activity inside the person is known as 'unconscious phantasy' (deliberately spelled with 'ph' to distinguish it from the word 'fantasy'). And these phantasies are often very violent and aggressive. They are different from ordinary day-dreams or 'fantasies'.\"\nThe term \"fantasy\" became a central issue with the development of the Kleinian group as a distinctive strand within the British Psycho-Analytical Society, and was at the heart of the so-called controversial discussions of the wartime years. \"A paper by Susan Isaacs (1952) on 'The nature and function of Phantasy' ... has been generally accepted by the Klein group in London as a fundamental statement of their position.\" As a defining feature, \"Kleinian psychoanalysts regard the unconscious as made up of phantasies of relations with objects. These are thought of as primary and innate, and as the mental representations of instincts ... the psychological equivalents in the mind of defence mechanisms.\"\nIsaacs considered that \"unconscious phantasies exert a continuous influence throughout life, both in normal and neurotic people, the difference lying in the specific character of the dominant phantasies.\" Most schools of psychoanalytic thought would now accept that both in analysis and life, we perceive reality through a veil of unconscious phantasy. Isaacs however claimed that \"Freud's 'hallucinatory wish-fulfilment' and his 'introjection' and 'projection' are the basis of the fantasy life,\" and how far unconscious phantasy was a genuine development of Freud's ideas, how far it represented the formation of a new psychoanalytic paradigm, is perhaps the key question of the controversial discussions.\n\n\n## Lacan, fantasy, and desire\n\nLacan engaged from early on with \"the phantasies revealed by Melanie Klein ... the imago of the mother ... this shadow of the bad internal objects\" \u2014 with the Imaginary. Increasingly, however, it was Freud's idea of fantasy as a kind of \"screen-memory, representing something of more importance with which it was in some way connected\" that was for him of greater importance. Lacan came to believe that \"the phantasy is never anything more than the screen that conceals something quite primary, something determinate in the function of repetition.\"\nPhantasies thus both link to and block off the individual's unconscious, his kernel or real core: \"subject and real are to be situated on either side of the split, in the resistance of the phantasy\", which thus comes close to the centre of the individual's personality and its splits and conflicts. \"The subject situates himself as determined by the phantasy ... whether in the dream or in any of the more or less well-developed forms of day-dreaming;\" and as a rule \"a subject's fantasies are close variations on a single theme ... the 'fundamental fantasy' ... minimizing the variations in meaning which might otherwise cause a problem for desire.\"\nThe goal of therapy thus became \"la travers\u00e9e du fantasme, the crossing over, traversal, or traversing of the fundamental fantasy.\" For Lacan, \"The traversing of fantasy involves the subject's assumption of a new position with respect to the Other as language and the Other as desire ... a utopian moment beyond neurosis.\" The question he was left with was \"What, then, does he who has passed through the experience ... who has traversed the radical phantasy ... become?.\"\n\n\n## The fantasy principle\n\nThe postmodern intersubjectivity of the 21st century has seen a new interest in fantasy as a form of interpersonal communication.  Here, we are told, \"We need to go beyond the pleasure principle, the reality principle, and repetition compulsion to ... the fantasy principle - not, as Freud did, reduce fantasies to wishes ... [but consider] all other imaginable emotions\" and thus envisage emotional fantasies as a possible means of moving beyond stereotypes to more nuanced forms of personal and social relating.\nSuch a perspective \"sees emotions as central to developing fantasies about each other that are not determined by collective 'typifications'.\"\n\n\n## In mental disorders\n\n\n\n### Narcissistic personality disorder\nTwo diagnostic criteria narcissistic personality disorder are:\n\nA pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior)\nA preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love.\n\n\n### Schizophrenia\nFantasy is a common symptom in individuals with schizophrenia; they depict specific patterns of high-neurological activities in their brains' default mode network, which possibly constitute the biomarker of these fantasies.\n\n\n## See also\n\n\n\n## References\n\n\n\n## Further reading\n\nMichael Vannoy Adams, The Fantasy Principle: Psychoanalysis of the Imagination (East Sussex 2004)\nJulia Segal, Phantasies in Everyday Life (1995)\nRiccardo Steiner ed., Unconscious Phantasy (Karnac 2003)\nG.

      "text": "# Folie_\u00e0_deux\n\nFolie \u00e0 deux (French for 'madness of two'), also called shared psychosis or shared delusional disorder (SDD), is a rare psychiatric syndrome in which symptoms of a delusional belief are \"transmitted\" from one individual to another.\nThe disorder, first conceptualized in 19th century French psychiatry by Charles Las\u00e8gue and Jules Falret, is also known as Las\u00e8gue\u2013Falret syndrome. Recent psychiatric classifications refer to the syndrome as shared psychotic disorder (DSM-4 \u2013 297.3) and induced delusional disorder (ICD-10 \u2013 F24), although the research literature largely uses the original name. The same syndrome shared by more than two people may be called folie \u00e0 trois ('three') or quatre ('four'); and further, folie en famille ('family madness') or even folie \u00e0 plusieurs ('madness of several').\nThis disorder is not in the current, fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which considers the criteria to be insufficient or inadequate. DSM-5 does not consider Shared Psychotic Disorder (folie \u00e0 deux) as a separate entity; rather, the physician should classify it as \"Delusional Disorder\" or in the \"Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder\" category.\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\nThis syndrome is most commonly diagnosed when the two or more individuals of concern live in proximity, may be socially or physically isolated, and have little interaction with other people.\nVarious sub-classifications of folie \u00e0 deux have been proposed to describe how the delusional belief comes to be held by more than one person: \n\nFolie impos\u00e9e\nWhere a dominant person (known as the 'primary', 'inducer', or 'principal') initially forms a delusional belief during a psychotic episode and imposes it on another person or persons (the 'secondary', 'acceptor', or 'associate'). Normally the latter, described as \"un malade par reflet\", does not suffer from a true psychosis. If the parties are admitted to hospital separately, the delusions in the person with the induced beliefs are typically abandoned.\nFolie simultan\u00e9e\nEither the situation where two people considered to independently experience psychosis influence the content of each other's delusions so they become identical or strikingly similar, or one in which two people \"morbidly predisposed\" to delusional psychosis mutually trigger symptoms in each other. Due to the lack of a dominant partner, separation of patients might not improve the condition of either.\nFolie \u00e0 deux and its more populous derivatives are psychiatric curiosities. The current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders states that a person cannot be diagnosed as being delusional if the belief in question is one \"ordinarily accepted by other members of the person's culture or subculture\". It is not clear at what point a belief considered to be delusional escapes from the folie \u00e0... diagnostic category and becomes legitimate because of the number of people holding it. When a large number of people may come to believe obviously false and potentially distressing things based purely on hearsay, these beliefs are not considered to be clinical delusions by the psychiatric profession, and are instead labelled as mass hysteria.\nAs with most psychological disorders, the extent and type of delusion varies, but the non-dominant person's delusional symptoms usually resemble those of the inducer. Prior to therapeutic interventions, the inducer typically does not realize that they are causing harm, but instead believe they are helping the second person to become aware of vital or otherwise notable information.\n\n\n### Type of delusions\nPsychology Today magazine defines delusions as \"fixed beliefs that do not change, even when a person is presented with conflicting evidence.\" Types of delusion include:\n\nBizarre delusions\nThose which are clearly implausible and not understood by peers within the same culture, even those with psychological disorders; for example, if one thought that all of their organs had been taken out and replaced by someone else's while they were asleep without leaving any scar and without their waking up. It would be impossible to survive such a procedure, and even surgery involving transplantation of multiple organs would leave the person with severe pain, visible scars, etc.\nNon-bizarre delusions\nCommon among those with personality disorders and are understood by people within the same culture. For example, unsubstantiated or unverifiable claims of being followed by the FBI in unmarked cars and watched via security cameras would be classified as a non-bizarre delusion; while it would be unlikely for the average person to experience such a predicament, it is possible, and therefore understood by those around them.\nMood-congruent delusions\nThese correspond to a person's emotions within a given timeframe, especially during an episode of mania or depression. For example, someone with this type of delusion may believe with certainty that they will win $1 million at the casino on a specific night, despite lacking any way to see the future or influence the probability of such an event. Similarly, someone in a depressive state may feel certain that their mother will get hit by lightning the next day, again in spite of having no means of predicting or controlling future events.\nMood-neutral delusions\nThese are unaffected by mood, and can be bizarre or non-bizarre; the formal definition provided by Mental Health Daily is \"a false belief that isn't directly related to the person's emotional state.\" An example would be a person who is convinced that somebody has switched bodies with their neighbor, the belief persisting irrespective of changes in emotional status.\n\n\n### Biopsychosocial effects\nAs with many psychiatric disorders, shared delusional disorder can negatively impact the psychological and social aspects of a person's wellbeing. Unresolved stress resulting from a delusional disorder will eventually contribute to or increase the risk of other negative health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, immunological problems, and others. These health risks increase with the severity of the disease, especially if an affected person does not receive or comply with adequate treatment.\nPeople with a delusional disorder have a significantly high risk of developing psychiatric comorbidities such as depression and anxiety. This may be attributable to a genetic pattern shared by 55% of SDD patients.\nShared delusional disorder can have a profoundly negative impact on a person's quality of life. Persons diagnosed with a mental health disorder commonly experience social isolation, which is detrimental to psychological health. This is especially problematic with SDD, as social isolation contributes to the onset of the disorder; in particular, relapse is likely if returning to an isolated living situation, in which shared delusions can be reinstated.\n\n\n## Causes\n\nWhile the exact causes of SDD are unknown, the main two contributors are stress and social isolation.\nPeople who are socially isolated together tend to become dependent on those they are with, leading to an inducer becoming able to influence those around them. Additionally, people developing shared delusional disorder do not have others reminding them that their delusions are either impossible or unlikely. As a result, treatment for shared delusional disorder includes those affected be removed from the inducer.\nStress is also a factor, as it is a common factor in mental illness developing or worsening. The majority of people that develop shared delusional disorder are genetically predisposed to mental illness, but this predisposition alone is not enough to develop SDD. In other words, stress is a risk factor of this disorder. When stressed, an individual's adrenal gland releases the stress hormone cortisol into the body, increasing the brain's level of dopamine; this change can be linked to the development of a mental illness, such as a shared delusional disorder.\nWhile there is no exact cause of shared psychosis, there are several factors that are contributors depending on different cultures and communities and taking into consideration the individual's circumstances, including their environmental changes and relationships.\n\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nShared delusional disorder is often difficult to diagnose. Usually, the person with the condition does not seek out treatment, as they do not realize that their delusion is abnormal, as it comes from someone in a dominant position whom they trust. Furthermore, since their delusion comes on gradually and grows in strength over time, their doubt is slowly weakened during this time. Shared delusional disorder is diagnosed using the DSM-5, and according to this, the patient must meet three criteria:\n\nThey must have a delusion that develops in the context of a close relationship with an individual exhibiting an already established delusion.\nThe delusion must be very similar or even identical to the one already established in the primary case.\nThe delusion cannot be better explained by any other psychological disorder, mood disorder with psychological features, as a direct result of physiological effects of substance abuse or any general medical condition.\n\n\n### Related phenomena\nReports have stated that a phenomenon similar to folie \u00e0 deux was induced by the military incapacitating agent BZ in the late 1960s.The chemical, also known as 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, was being researched as a potential incapacitating agent, and its effects on mental state, including inducing a shared delusion, were observed in research studies. \n\n\n### Prevalence\nShared delusional disorder is most commonly found in women with slightly above-average IQs, who are isolated from their family, and who are in relationships with a dominant person who has delusions. The majority of secondary cases (people who develop the shared delusion) also meet the criteria for dependent personality disorder, which is characterized by a pervasive fear that leads them to need constant reassurance, support, and guidance. Additionally, 55% of secondary cases had a relative with a psychological disorder that included delusions and, as a result, the secondary cases are usually susceptible to mental illness.\n\n\n## Treatment\n\nAfter diagnosis, the next step is to determine the proper course of treatment. The first step is to separate the formerly healthy person from the inducer, and see if the delusion goes away or lessens over time. If this is not enough to stop the delusions, there are two possible courses of action: medication or therapy. Therapy can be provided as both personal therapy or family therapy.\n\n\n### Medication\nIf the separation alone is not working, antipsychotics are often prescribed for a short time to prevent the delusions. Antipsychotics are medications that reduce or relieve symptoms of psychosis such as delusions or hallucinations (seeing or hearing something that is not there). Other uses of antipsychotics include stabilizing moods for people with mood swings and mood disorders (i.e. in bipolar patients), reducing anxiety in anxiety disorders, and lessening tics in people with Tourettes. Antipsychotics do not cure psychosis, but they do help reduce symptoms; when paired with therapy, the person with the condition has the best chance of recovering. While antipsychotics are powerful, and often effective, they do have side effects, such as inducing involuntary movements. They should only be taken if absolutely required, and under the supervision of a psychiatrist.\n\n\n### Therapy\nThe two most common forms of therapy for patients are personal and family therapy.\nPersonal therapy is one-on-one counseling that focuses on building a relationship between the counselor and the patient, and aims to create a positive environment where the patient feels that they can speak freely and truthfully. This is advantageous, as the counselor can usually get more information out of the patient to get a better idea of how to help them. Additionally, if the patient trusts what the counselor says, disproving the delusion will be easier.\nFamily therapy is a technique in which the entire family comes into therapy together to work on their relationships, and to find ways to eliminate the delusion within the family dynamic. For example, if someone's sister is the inducer, the family will have to get involved to ensure the two stay apart, and to sort out how the family dynamic will work around that. The more support a patient has, the more likely they are to recover, especially since SDD usually occurs due to social isolation.\n\n\n## Society and culture\n\n\n\n### Notable cases\nIn May 2008, in the case of twin sisters Ursula and Sabina Eriksson, Ursula ran into the path of an oncoming articulated lorry, sustaining severe injuries. Sabina then immediately duplicated her twin's actions by stepping into the path of an oncoming car; both sisters survived the incident with severe but non-life-threatening injuries. It was later claimed that Sabina Eriksson was a \"secondary\" sufferer of folie \u00e0 deux, influenced by the presence or perceived presence of her twin sister Ursula, the \"primary\". Sabina later told an officer at the police station, \"We say in Sweden that an accident rarely comes alone. Usually at least one more follows\u2014maybe two.\" However, upon her release from hospital, Sabina behaved erratically before stabbing a man to death.\nPsychiatrist Reginald Medlicott published an article about the Parker\u2013Hulme murder case, called \"Paranoia of the Exalted Type in a Setting of Folie a Deux \u2013 A Study of Two Adolescent Homicides,\" arguing that the intense relationship and shared fantasy world of the two teenaged friends reinforced and exacerbated the mental illness that led to the murder: \"each acted on the other as a resonator, increasing the pitch of their narcissism.\"\nPsychologists H. O'Connell and P. G. Doyle believe folie \u00e0 plusieurs to have been at least a partial factor in the murder of Bridget Cleary. In 1895, Michael Cleary convinced several friends and relatives that his wife, Bridget Cleary, was a changeling who had been replaced by a fairy. They assisted him in physically abusing her to \"cast the fairies\" out, before he ultimately burned her to death shortly afterwards.\nChristine and L\u00e9a Papin were two French sisters who, as live-in maids, were convicted of murdering their employer's wife and daughter in Le Mans, France, on 2 February 1933.\nBorn in Yemen in 1963 to Barbados immigrants, June and Jennifer Gibbons were known as \"the Silent Twins\" for speaking solely to each other in an idioglossia derived from an idiosyncratic, sped-up Bajan Creole dialect that qualified as an example of cryptophasia. The inseparable twins had a longstanding agreement that, if one died, the other must begin to speak and live a normal life, and it was during their 11-year admission to Broadmoor Hospital \u2014 where the twins had been indefinitely placed following a series of crimes (e.g. vandalism, petty theft and arson) in 1981 \u2014 that they began to believe that it was necessary for one of them to die. Jennifer agreed it should be her, and when the twins were transferred from Broadmoor to the more open Caswell Clinic in Bridgend, Wales in 1993, Jennifer could not be roused upon arrival. She was taken to the hospital where she died soon after of acute myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart. As no drugs or poison were found in her system, her death remains a mystery. Fulfilling their pact, June proceeded to live an otherwise normal life.\nThe Burari Deaths, wherein a family of 11 members was found hanging in their home in Delhi, was ruled as a case of \"shared psychosis\", led by the youngest son of the matriarch.\nIn July 2015, in the case of siblings Robert and Michael Bever, the pair murdered their family due to a shared fantasy of going on a mass shooting spree. According to Michael, they hoped to have a kill count of 50 people.\nIn 2007, nine members of the Aadom family committed suicide in a small town of Bangladesh by walking in front of a moving train. The Aadoms believed in an anti-Islamic faith, the Aadom religion, founded by the father, Anwar Darbesh, who had died seven years prior.\n\n\n### In popular culture\nThe disorder has been depicted frequently in popular culture, namely in films, series, books and music, such as: \n\nSerbian poet Sima Pandurovic wrote a love poem \"Svetkovina (Festivity)\" in 1908 using the folie a deux metaphor.\nIn the psychological thriller anime Perfect Blue, the protagonist experiences psychosis after leaving the J-pop industry to pursue a career in acting. She hallucinates her former popstar self, who repeatedly tells her that she is an imposter. She eventually learns that she is sharing the same delusion with the film's two main antagonists, fueling their motives for trying to harm her.\nIn the \"Folie \u00e0 Deux\" episode of The X-Files, Fox Mulder is taken hostage by an employee who believes his boss is turning his coworkers into zombies.\nIn season 4, episode 3 of Six Feet Under (2004), George mentions Folie \u00e0 deux to Ruth.\nBug (2006) is a film that depicts a couple with a shared delusion that aphids are living under their skin.\nIn season 2, episode 3 of Criminal Minds, \"The Perfect Storm\" (2006), Dr. Reid mentions that the rapists had this condition. The condition is mentioned again in season 13, episode 21, \"Mixed Signals\" (2018), about a murderer receiving the delusion from his deceased wife.\nLike Minds (2006) portrays folie \u00e0 deux through the obsessive and manipulative relationship between two teenage boys, Alex and Nigel. As Nigel imposes his delusional beliefs about religion, ritual, death, and destiny, Alex gradually adopts his worldview, blurring the line between influence and shared madness. The film presents their psychological bond as a closed system, where reality is rewritten through isolation, control, and emotional dependency. The film also reflects Gestalt psychology, showing how the mind seeks patterns and meaning even in violence when individuals become part of a closed psychological system.\nFolie \u00e0 Deux (2008) is the name of an album by American rock band Fall Out Boy.\nFolie \u00e0 Deux is the name of a song on the album Pray for Haiti  (2021) by rapper and producer Mach-Hommy.\nThe independent film Apart (2011) depicts two lovers affected and diagnosed with induced delusional disorder, trying to uncover a mysterious and tragic past they share. In a 2011 interview, director Aaron Rottinghaus stated the film was based on research from actual case studies.\nIn the third and fourth episodes of the Second series of Luther, the main antagonist are two twin brothers who suffer from shared psychosis.\nNine Perfect Strangers shows a couple who lost one of their two children. The couple and the surviving child have shared hallucinations of the dead child.\nAny Porth in a Storm: The Long-Distance Walk that Goes South (2021), a travelogue by Oscar Burton, has a chapter with the title 'Folie \u00e0 deux', referencing meeting another person dressed identically and with the same equipment who was also walking the 1000 km South West Coast Path in England. It is suggestive of the mental decay of the protagonist which becomes evident later in the story.\nThe film The Vanished portrays a couple, suffering from folie \u00e0 deux, that have hallucinations that their dead daughter is still alive.\nThe concept of folie \u00e0 deux is referenced in the third episode of Season 1 \"Potage\" of the NBC series Hannibal (2013\u20132015). It is described as \"madness shared by two\" by Dr. Alana Bloom.\nPerpetrators of an armed siege are described as experiencing folie \u00e0 deux in the special episode The Siege of the Channel 4 series 24 Hours in Police Custody (2023).\nThe DC Comics film Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux (2024), a sequel to Joker (2019), shares its subtitle with the disorder.\n\n\n## See also\n\n\n\n## References\n\n\n\n## Further reading\n\n\n\n### Books\nEnoch, D., and H.

Depending on their location and function, ganglion cells can be categorized into several major groups:\n\nRetinal ganglion cell (RGC) found in the ganglion cell layer of the retina\nCells that reside in the adrenal medulla, where they are involved in the sympathetic nervous system's release of epinephrine and norepinephrine into the blood stream\nCells of the sympathetic ganglia\nCells of the parasympathetic ganglia\nCells of the spiral ganglia\n\n\n## General Morphology\n\nDuring the late 1800s, early 1900s, Spanish Neuroscientist and Pathologist Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal proposed Neuron theory which basically introduced the idea that the Nervous system contained cells called the Neuron. The process he used was called Golgi staining of the vertebrate retina. Cajal was able to differentiate between \ndifferent types of Ganglion cell based on dendritic morphology, cell body and dendritic tree size, and number of sub layers in which they arborize/stratification layers. Through this study, he discovered that the ganglion cell distribution amongst vertebrates were pretty similar minus the Rods and cones in the retinas.\nIn the 1940s, American Neurologist Stephen Polyak produced description of the Golgi-impregnated Cells that helped further classify types of Ganglion Cells. This data helped scientists get a better understanding of the ganglion cells present in the retinas of Mammals and Primates\nIn 1974, Boycott and Wassle created a scheme for the classification of Ganglion Cells that was found to be in the cat retina. These cells, alpha, beta, delta and gamma are seen to be linked with the X,Y and W types of physiology. Boycott and Wassle confirmed the idea of Cajal's Ox and Dog retina idea by naming the alpha and beta.\nIn 1978, the idea of the alpha and beta ganglion cells could be divided into different subgroups, sublamina a and sublamina b. Sublamina a contains dendrite cells containing OFF-center receptive fields while the Sublamina b contains On-center receptive fields.\n\n\n## Types of Retinal Ganglion Cells\n\nThe most studied classes are the parvocellular (P), magnocellular (M), and koniocellular (K) cells, with a fourth class, the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). \nParvocellular (P) Cells : P-cells make up approximately 70% of all ganglion cells. They are highly concentrated in the fovea. They exhibit center-surround receptive fields and are primarily involved in processing fine spatial detail and color. These cells have high spatial acuity vision and have strong color opponency. However, their temporal resolution is very poor and have low contrast sensitivity.\nMagnocellular (M) cells : M-cells contain 10% of the RGCs, and show center-surround receptive fields and is more responsive to changes in luminance and motion. They are crucial for detecting motion and depth because they possess contrast sensitivity and high temporal resolution. In comparison to P cells, Magnocellular (M) cells do not display color opponency, and have much lower spatial resolution.\nKoniocellular (K) Cells : K-cells only account for 10% of total ganglion cell population. These cells have irregular receptive field and do not show center-surround feature. They haven't been fully understood yet but are known to be involved in processing blue-yellow color contrast and overall illumination changes. They project in a patchy and disorganized way to the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN). These cells are believed to have a role in motion detection but their exact function is still unknown. \nIntrinsically Photosensitive Retinal Ganglion cells (ipRGCs) : These cells are the fourth type and constitute a different subset of RGCs that contain melanopsin, a photopigment that allows them to respond to light directly without any input from cones or rods. ipRGCs represent non-image forming function functions like sleep-wake cycles, pupillary light reflex, and circadian rhythm regulation. It sends signals to the SCN (suprachiasmatic nucleus) of the hypothalamus through the retinohypothalamic tract. Their photo-transduction mechanism differs from the cone and rod pathways and involves a melanopsin based G-protein cascade and TRP channels.\n\n\n## Disorders Relating to Ganglion Cells\n\n",
