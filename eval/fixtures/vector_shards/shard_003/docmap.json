      "text": "# Delusion\n\nA delusion is a fixed belief that is not amenable to change in light of conflicting evidence. As a pathology, it is distinct from a belief based on false or incomplete information, confabulation, dogma, illusion, hallucination, or some other misleading effects of perception, as individuals with those beliefs are able to change or readjust their beliefs upon reviewing the evidence. However:\n\"The distinction between a delusion and a strongly held idea is sometimes difficult to make and depends in part on the degree of conviction with which the belief is held despite clear or reasonable contradictory evidence regarding its veracity.\"\nDelusions occur in the context of many pathological states (both general physical and mental) and are of particular diagnostic importance in psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, paraphrenia, manic episodes of bipolar disorder, and psychotic depression.\n\n\n## Types\n\nDelusions are categorized into four different groups:\n\nBizarre delusion: Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible and not understandable to same-culture peers and do not derive from ordinary life experiences. An example named by the DSM-5 is a belief that someone replaced all of one's internal organs with someone else's without leaving a scar, depending on the organ in question.\nNon-bizarre delusion: A delusion that, though false, reflects real\u2013life situations and is at least technically possible; it may include feelings of being followed, poisoned, infected etc. e.g., the affected person mistakenly believes that they are under constant police surveillance.\nMood-congruent delusion: Any delusion with content consistent with either a depressive or manic state, e.g., a depressed person believes that news anchors on television highly disapprove of them, or a person in a manic state might believe they are a powerful deity.\nMood-neutral delusion: A delusion that does not relate to the patient's emotional state; for example, a belief that an extra limb is growing out of the back of one's head is neutral to either depression or mania.\nFrench psychiatry (which is influenced by psychoanalysis), however, also establishes a difference between \"paranoid\" (parano\u00efde) and \"paranoiac\" (parano\u00efaque) delusion. The paranoid delusion, observed in schizophrenia, is non-systematized and is characterized by a disorganized structure and confused speech and thoughts. The paranoiac delusion, observed in paraphrenia, is highly systematized (which means it is very organized and clear) and focuses on a single theme.\n\n\n### Themes\nIn addition to these categories, delusions often manifest according to a consistent theme. Although delusions can have any theme, certain themes are more common. Some of the more common delusion themes are:\n\nDelusion of control: False belief that another person, group of people, or external force controls one's general thoughts, feelings, impulses, or behaviors.\nDelusional jealousy: False belief that a spouse or lover is having an affair, with no proof to back up the claim.\nDelusion of guilt or sin (or delusion of self-accusation): Ungrounded feeling of remorse or guilt of delusional intensity.\nThought broadcasting: False belief that other people can know one's thoughts.\nDelusion of thought insertion: Belief that another thinks through the mind of the person.\nPersecutory delusions: False belief that one is being persecuted.\nDelusion of reference: False belief that insignificant remarks, events, or objects in one's environment have personal meaning or significance. \"Usually the meaning assigned to these events is negative, but the 'messages' can also have a grandiose quality.\"\nErotomania: False belief that another person is in love with them.\nReligious delusion: Belief that the affected person is a god or chosen to act as a god.\nSomatic delusion: Delusion whose content pertains to bodily functioning, bodily sensations or physical appearance. Usually the false belief is that the body is somehow diseased, abnormal or changed. A specific example of this delusion is delusional parasitosis: Delusion in which one feels infested with insects, bacteria, mites, spiders, lice, fleas, worms, or other organisms.\nDelusion of poverty: Person strongly believes they are financially incapacitated. Although this type of delusion is less common now, it was particularly widespread in the days preceding state support.\n\n\n### Grandiose delusions\nGrandiose delusions or delusions of grandeur are principally a subtype of delusional disorder but could possibly feature as a symptom of schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar disorder. Grandiose delusions are characterized by fantastical beliefs that one is famous, omnipotent or otherwise very powerful. The delusions are generally fantastical, often with a supernatural, science-fictional, or religious bent. In colloquial usage, one who overestimates one's own abilities, talents, stature or situation is sometimes said to have \"delusions of grandeur\". This is generally due to excessive pride, rather than any actual delusions. Grandiose delusions or delusions of grandeur can also be associated with megalomania.\n\n\n### Persecutory delusions\n\nPersecutory delusions are the most common type of delusions and involve the theme of being followed, harassed, cheated, poisoned or drugged, conspired against, spied on, attacked, or otherwise obstructed in the pursuit of goals. The person affected by a persecutory delusion wrongly believes that they are being persecuted. Specifically, for a person's delusion to be defined as persecutory, they must believe the following two central elements:\n\nharm is occurring, or is going to occur\nthe persecutors have the intention to cause harm\nAccording to the DSM-IV-TR, persecutory delusions are the most common form of delusions in schizophrenia, where the person believes they are \"being tormented, followed, sabotaged, tricked, spied on, or ridiculed\". The DSM-IV-TR also identifies persecutory delusions as the main feature of the persecutory type of delusional disorder. When the focus is remedying some injustice by legal action, they are sometimes called \"querulous paranoia\".\n\n\n## Causes\n\n\nWhile explaining the causes of delusions remains a challenge, researchers have developed several theories. The genetic or biological theory holds that close relatives of people with delusional disorder are at increased risk of developing delusional traits. Another theory is dysfunctional cognitive processing, according to which delusions arise from distorted ways in which individuals view themselves. A third theory is motivated or defensive delusions, according to which individuals who are predisposed to delusional disorder may develop it at times when they are struggling to cope with life and maintaining high self-esteem. In this case, the person views others as the cause of their personal difficulties in order to preserve a positive self-concept.\nDelusional thinking is more common among people who have poor hearing or sight. The probability of developing delusions is also higher where there are ongoing stressors, such as immigration, low socioeconomic status, and possibly the accumulation of smaller daily struggles.\n\n\n### Specific delusions\nThe two largest factors in the formation of delusions are disorders of brain functioning and background influences of temperament and personality.\nHigher levels of dopamine are a sign of disorders of brain functioning. A preliminary 2002 study on delusional disorder (a psychotic syndrome) examined the role of elevated dopamine levels in sustaining certain delusions, in order to establish whether schizophrenia was linked to dopamine abnormalities. The results confirmed the theory, showing that individuals with delusions of jealousy and persecution had different levels of dopamine metabolite HVA and homovanillyl alcohol; the cause of this may in turn be genetic. The authors cautioned that the results were preliminary and called for future research with a larger population. Also, factors beyond dopamine impact the development of a specific delusion; studies show age and gender are influential and HVA levels likely change during the life course of some syndromes.\nOn the influence of personality, Andrew Sims wrote: \"Jaspers considered there is a subtle change in personality due to the illness itself; and this creates the condition for the development of the delusional atmosphere in which the delusional intuition arises.\"\nCultural factors have \"a decisive influence in shaping delusions\". For example, delusions of guilt and punishment are frequent in Austria (a Western, Christian country), but not in Pakistan, where delusions are more often about persecution. Similarly, in a series of case studies, delusions of guilt and punishment were found in Austrian patients with Parkinson's disease being treated with l-dopa, a dopamine agonist.\n\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nThe two-factor model of delusions posits that dysfunction in both belief formation systems and belief evaluation systems are necessary for delusions. Neuroimaging studies support the view that dysfunction in evaluations systems is localized to the right lateral prefrontal cortex, regardless of delusion content, and this is congruent with its role in conflict monitoring in healthy persons. Abnormal activation and reduced volume in this region are seen in people with delusions, as well as in disorders associated with delusions such as frontotemporal dementia, psychosis and Lewy body dementia. Furthermore, lesions to the right lateral prefrontal cortex are associated with \"jumping to conclusions\", damage to this region is associated with post-stroke delusions, and hypometabolism in this region is associated with caudate strokes presenting with delusions.\nThe aberrant salience model suggests that delusions are a result of people assigning excessive importance to irrelevant stimuli. In support of this hypothesis, regions normally associated with the salience network demonstrate reduced grey matter in people with delusions, and the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is widely implicated in salience processing, is also widely implicated in psychotic disorders.\nAbnormalities in specific regions have been associated with specific types of delusions. The volume of the hippocampus and parahippocampus is related to paranoid delusions in Alzheimer's disease, and has been reported to be abnormal post mortem in one person with delusions. Capgras delusions have been associated with occipito-temporal damage and may be related to failure to elicit normal emotions or memories in response to faces.\n\n\n## Definition and diagnosis\n\n\nAlthough non-specific concepts of madness have been around for several thousand years, the psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspers was the first to define the four main criteria for a belief to be considered delusional in his 1913 book General Psychopathology. These criteria are:\n\ncertainty (held with absolute conviction)\nincorrigibility (not changeable by compelling counterargument or proof to the contrary)\nimpossibility or falsity of content (implausible, bizarre, or patently untrue)\nnot amenable to understanding (i.e., belief cannot be explained psychologically)\nFurthermore, when beliefs involve value judgments, only those which cannot be proven true are considered delusions. For example: a man claiming that he flew into the Sun and flew back home. This would be considered a delusion, unless he were speaking figuratively, or if the belief had a cultural or religious source. Only the first three criteria remain cornerstones of the current definition of a delusion in the DSM-5.\nRobert Trivers writes that delusion is a discrepancy in relation to objective reality, but with a firm conviction in reality of delusional ideas, which is manifested in the \"affective basis of delusion\".\n\n\n### Debate over definitions\nThe modern definition and Jaspers' original criteria have been criticised, as counter-examples can be shown for every defining feature.\nStudies on psychiatric patients show that delusions vary in intensity and conviction over time, which suggests that certainty and incorrigibility are not necessary components of a delusional belief.\nDelusions do not necessarily have to be false or \"incorrect inferences about external reality\". Some religious or spiritual beliefs by their nature may not be falsifiable, and hence cannot be described as false or incorrect, no matter whether the person holding these beliefs was diagnosed as delusional or not.\nIn other situations the delusion may turn out to be true belief. For example, in delusional jealousy, where a person believes that their partner is being unfaithful (and may even follow them into the bathroom believing them to be seeing their lover even during the briefest of partings), it may actually be true that the partner is having sexual relations with another person. In this case, the delusion does not cease to be a delusion because the content later turns out to be verified as true or the partner actually chose to engage in the behavior of which they were being accused.\nIn other cases, the belief may be mistakenly assumed to be false by a doctor or psychiatrist assessing it, just because it seems to be unlikely, bizarre or held with excessive conviction. Psychiatrists rarely have the time or resources to check the validity of a person's claims leading to some true beliefs to be erroneously classified as delusional. This is known as the Martha Mitchell effect, after the wife of the attorney general who alleged that illegal activity was taking place in the White House. At the time, her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness, and only after the Watergate scandal broke was she proved right (and hence sane).\nSimilar factors have led to criticisms of Jaspers' definition of true delusions as being ultimately \"un-understandable\". Critics (such as R. D. Laing) have argued that this leads to the diagnosis of delusions being based on the subjective understanding of a particular psychiatrist, who may not have access to all the information that might make a belief otherwise interpretable. R. D. Laing's hypothesis has been applied to some forms of projective therapy to \"fix\" a delusional system so that it cannot be altered by the patient. Psychiatric researchers at Yale University, Ohio State University and the Community Mental Health Center of Middle Georgia have used novels and motion picture films as the focus. Texts, plots and cinematography are discussed and the delusions approached tangentially. This use of fiction to decrease the malleability of a delusion was employed in a joint project by science-fiction author Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer and Yale psychiatrist A. James Giannini. They wrote the novel Red Orc's Rage, which, recursively, deals with delusional adolescents who are treated with a form of projective therapy. In this novel's fictional setting other novels written by Farmer are discussed and the characters are symbolically integrated into the delusions of fictional patients. This particular novel was then applied to real-life clinical settings.\nAnother difficulty with the diagnosis of delusions is that almost all of these features can be found in \"normal\" beliefs. Many religious beliefs hold exactly the same features, yet are not universally considered delusional. For instance, if a person was holding a true belief then they will of course persist with it. This can cause the disorder to be misdiagnosed by psychiatrists. These factors have led the psychiatrist Anthony David to note that \"there is no acceptable (rather than accepted) definition of a delusion.\" In practice, psychiatrists tend to diagnose a belief as delusional if it is either patently bizarre, causing significant distress, or excessively pre-occupying the patient, especially if the person is subsequently unswayed in belief by counter-evidence or reasonable arguments.\nPsychiatrist Joseph Pierre states that one factor that helps differentiate delusions from other kinds of beliefs is that anomalous subjective experiences are often used to justify delusional beliefs. While idiosyncratic and self-referential content often make delusions impossible to share with others, Pierre suggests that it may be more helpful to emphasize the level of conviction, preoccupation, and extension of a belief rather than the content of the belief when considering whether a belief is delusional.\nIt is important to distinguish true delusions from other symptoms such as anxiety, fear, or paranoia. To diagnose delusions a mental state examination may be used. This test includes appearance, mood, affect, behavior, rate and continuity of speech, evidence of hallucinations or abnormal beliefs, thought content, orientation to time, place and person, attention and concentration, insight and judgment, as well as short-term memory.\nJohnson-Laird suggests that delusions may be viewed as the natural consequence of failure to distinguish conceptual relevance. That is, irrelevant information would be framed as disconnected experiences, then it is taken to be relevant in a manner that suggests false causal connections. Furthermore, relevant information would be ignored as counterexamples.\n\n\n## Treatment\n\nDelusions and other positive symptoms of psychosis are often treated with antipsychotic medication, which reduce symptoms with a medium effect size according to a meta-analysis. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) improves delusions relative to control conditions according to a meta-analysis. A meta-analysis of 43 studies reported that metacognitive training (MCT) reduces delusions at a medium to large effect size relative to control conditions.\n\n\n## Criticism\n\nSome psychiatrists criticize the practice of defining one and the same belief as normal in one culture and pathological in another culture, arguing that it is based in cultural essentialism. They argue that it is not justified to assume that culture can be simplified to a few traceable, distinguishable and statistically quantifiable factors and that everything outside those factors must be biological; rather, cultural influences are mixed, including not only parents and teachers but also peers, friends, and media, and the same cultural influence can have different effects depending on earlier cultural influences. Other critical psychiatrists argue that just because a person's belief is unshaken by one influence does not prove that it would remain unshaken by another. For example, a person whose beliefs are not changed by verbal correction from a psychiatrist, which is how delusion is usually diagnosed, may still change his or her mind when observing empirical evidence; the critics state that psychiatrists rarely, if ever, present patients with such evidence.\n\n\n## See also\n\n\n\n## Footnotes\n\n\n\n## References\n\n\nCited text\nJaspers K (1997).

      "text": "# Diffusion_of_responsibility\n\nDiffusion of responsibility is a sociopsychological phenomenon whereby a person is less likely to take responsibility for action or inaction when other bystanders or witnesses are present. Considered a form of attribution, the individual assumes that others either are responsible for taking action or have already done so.\nThe diffusion of responsibility refers to the decreased responsibility of action each member of a group feels when they are part of a group. For example, in emergency situations, individuals feel less responsibility to respond or call for help, if they know that there are others also watching the situation \u2013\nif they know they are a part of the group of witnesses. In other group settings (in which a group is appointed to complete a task or reach a certain goal), the diffusion of responsibility manifests itself as the decreased responsibility each member feels to contribute and work hard towards accomplishing the task or goal. The diffusion of responsibility is present in almost all groups, but to varying degrees, and can be mitigated by reducing group size, defining clear expectations, and increasing accountability.\nAssumption of responsibility tends to decrease when the potential helping group is larger, resulting in little aiding behavior demonstrated by the bystander(s). Causes range from psychological effects of anonymity to differences in sex. Implication of behaviours related to diffusion of responsibility can be threatening as there have been increases in moral disengagement and helping behaviour.\n\n\n## Real-world examples\n\nIn many real-world examples, it can be difficult to say with complete certainty that certain events happened or happen because of a sociopsychological effect such as diffusion of responsibility, the reasons being that in these events, there are many other contributing factors. Many of these events have also been traumatizing for the individuals who have recounted them. In situations which have known to increase anxiety, events have been found to be interpreted more dangerously or inaccurately than they appear. While accurate representation of events may be questionable, there have been extensive analyses on the following events regarding diffusion of responsibility and applications of its concept.\n\n\n### World War II\nThe diffusion of responsibility for alleged war crimes during World War II was famously used as a legal defense by many of the Nazis being tried at Nuremberg. A similar defense was mounted by the defendants accused in the My Lai massacre. Because of the displacement of responsibility, they did not feel the personal responsibility to help or at least not harm victims, but they felt like they were just following orders, and they did not feel responsible or guilty for their own actions. They blamed those telling them to carry out the orders rather than blaming themselves for the atrocities they had committed. The diffusion of responsibility is a probable cause for many of their feelings and actions, but other possible contributing factors include the existing antisemitism of Germany at that time and the threats imposed by Nazi officials.\n\n\n### Workplace\nDiffusion of responsibility can be seen in the workplace through the response to mass email when compared to many, individualized emails. When mass emails are sent out, people feel a lack of accountability because the emails have not been addressed to them personally. Studies have shown that replies to personally addressed emails are more helpful and lengthier than replies to mass emails because personal interactions are associated with a greater sense of responsibility. For example, the author of  reports sending thousands of emails to professors at universities worldwide, inviting them to recommend a journal to their students. The response rate has been extremely low, especially when using blind carbon copy (bcc) to reach multiple recipients simultaneously.\nAnother example of diffusion of responsibility revolves around whistleblowing in the work place. Many people employed by companies that regularly committed accounting fraud do not blow the whistle. This is due to lack of individual accountability and moral disengagement. It has been shown that many people often get so focused on their individual tasks, they forget to think about moral responsibilities in an organization. Thus whistleblowing may not even be considered. Moreover, in companies where it is promoted, people still do not participate since they assume others will take the responsibility, causing feelings similar to a lack of accountability.\n\n\n### Self-driving cars\nSemi-autonomous cars require a human driver to be attentive at all times, and intervene if necessary. One safety concern is that humans are less likely to maintain attention if the automated system has partial responsibility for driving.\n\n\n## Causes\n\nDiffusion of responsibility occurs in large group settings and under both prosocial and antisocial conditions. In prosocial situations, individuals' willingness to intervene or assist someone in need is inhibited by the presence of other people. The individual is under the belief that other people present will or should intervene.  Thus, the individual does not perceive it as her or his responsibility to take action. This will not happen if the individual believes that they are the only one aware of the situation. If a bystander is deciding how to help, they may abstain from doing so if they believe that they lack the competence to be of aid. Individuals may become reluctant to provide help for fear of how observers will view them.\n\n\n### Anonymity\nIn addition, diffusion of responsibility is more likely to occur under conditions of anonymity.  In prosocial situations, individuals are less likely to intervene when they do not know the victim personally.  Instead, they believe that someone who has a relationship with the victim will assist.  In antisocial situations, negative behaviours are more likely to be carried out when the person is in a group of similarly motivated individuals. The behaviour is driven by the deindividuating effects of group membership and the diffusion of feelings of personal responsibility for the consequences. As part of this process, individuals become less self-aware and feel an increased sense of anonymity.  As a result, they are less likely to feel responsible for any antisocial behaviour performed by their group.  Diffusion of responsibility is also a causal factor governing much crowd behaviour, as well as risk-taking in groups.\nContrary to anonymity, it has been shown that if one can utilise technology to prevent anonymity, it can further prevent diffusion of responsibility. Studies have shown that if emails are sent directly to individuals as opposed to addressing individuals in mass emails, they can prevent diffusion of responsibility and elicit more responses. In addition to eliciting more responses, the responses that were received from individuals, as opposed to groups, were longer and more helpful to the initial questions asked.\n\n\n### Division of labor\nDiffusion of responsibility can manifest itself in the workplace when tasks are assigned to individuals in terms of division of labor. In an economics context, diffusion of responsibility can be observed in groups when a leader assigns tasks to individuals. To promote the concept of fairness, the leader will generally assign an equal amount of work to individuals within the group. This is in part due to the idea that people in general want to seem fair and kind.\nAccording to Albert Bandura, diffusion of responsibility can occur when managers create subtasks in an organization. When people are subdivided into individual tasks they can often forget their role to the organization as a whole and get narrow minded into focusing on their own role. Individuals may unknowingly diffuse their responsibility to an organization by only doing what is required of them in their respective tasks. This is because their focus for accountability is diverted from the organization to their individualized tasks.\n\n\n### Expertise\nIn organisations, diffusion of responsibility can be observed on the basis of roles and differing levels of expertise. For instance, in a hierarchical structure, where your position in the organisation is associated with your level of engagement to the group, people tend to diffuse accountability to those with greater responsibility and a higher level in the structure. Evidence from numerous research studies suggests \"followers\" have not taken responsibility because they feel they have a lower status in the organisation. Many individuals in a group assume those with a greater level of power are held accountable for more and assume they take on a greater level of responsibility. The association of level of expertise or role and the amount of work required can cause people to feel varying levels of responsibility and accountability for their own contributions.\n\n\n### Group size\nBecause of the diffusion of responsibility, people feel that their need to intervene in a situation decreases as the number of other (perceived) witnesses increases. In an experiment that John Darley and Bibb Latan\u00e9 conducted in 1968, it was found that a subject was much less likely to help someone having a seizure when the subject thought that at least one other subject was also hearing the individual have a seizure. The subject's likeliness to help decreased with the number of other subjects (up to four) he or she thought were also listening to the seizure. Group size is a key factor to the diffusion of responsibility, as in a different study, it was additionally found that the probability of an individual volunteering to be a primary helper or leader also decreases as the size of the group grows.\n\n\n### Gender\nResearch in the past has shown that gender does play a role in terms of how people make decisions about helping others. With regards to social responsibility of helping others in need, people feel less inclined to help those who they think need it less. Based on previous research, people have generally helped women and diffusion of responsibility is more prevalent when males have needed help because the general stereotype was that men don't need help and can handle situations on their own, whereas women were perceived as weaker than men. New research has shown that with changing viewpoints on gender stereotypes, diffusion of responsibility is less prevalent when a lone woman is in need of assistance due to the women's liberation movement, which has helped change those stereotypes.\n\n\n## Consequences\n\n\n\n### Groupthink\nGroupthink occurs when each of the individuals composing a group desires and cares more about reaching consensus and total agreement than critically examining, understanding, and utilising information.\nEngaging in groupthink seeks to avoid any possible conflict or disagreement when making any decisions or actions, preferring compromises that may not be thought through to well-thought out arguments that do not receive unanimous approval from the group. Thus, groupthink cannot lead to the best decisions or solutions. Groupthink occurs when the group members are familiar with each other and seek each other's approval, especially in stressful situations. The diffusion of responsibility contributes to groupthink as when the diffusion of responsibility is occurring within a group, each group member feels less of a responsibility to express his or her own opinions or ideas, which leads to groupthink. Thus, when diffusion of responsibility occurs within groups, groupthink is also much more likely to occur.\n\n\n### Social loafing\nSocial loafing is the tendency for individuals to expend less effort when working collectively than when working individually. Social impact theory considers the extent to which individuals can be viewed as either sources or targets of social influence. When individuals work collectively, the demands of an outside source of social influence (e.g., an experimenter or one's boss) are diffused across multiple targets (i.e., diffusion of responsibility across all of the group members), leading to decreased levels of effort. On individual tasks, no such diffusion takes place, and individuals work hard, as there is no diffusion of responsibility. The division of social influence is thought to be a function of the strength, immediacy, and number of sources and targets present, and is predicted to follow an inverse power function specifying that each additional group member will have less influence as group size increases. Diffusion of responsibility is a direct cause of social loafing, as when diffusion of responsibility is occurring within a group, group members do not feel as responsible for their actions (or lack of action) and are much more likely to engage in social loafing.\n\n\n### Helping behavior\nSocial psychological  experiments have demonstrated that individuals' failure to assist others in emergencies is not due to apathy or indifference, but rather to the presence of other people. This is explained by both bystander effect and diffusion of responsibility. In 1968 and a series of experiments that followed, John Darley and Bibb Latan\u00e9 demonstrated that an individual's choice to help or intervene when there is an emergency depends on the number of bystanders. Group size significantly influenced the likelihood of helping behavior in a staged emergency: 85% of participants responded with intervention when alone, 62% of participants took action when with one other person, and only 31% did when there were four other bystanders. Other studies have replicated the phenomenon, including reports from real emergencies such as calling an ambulance for overdose patients and offering CPR after cardiac arrest.\nIn ambiguous situations, the individual's appraisal of the situation and subsequent action or inaction largely depends on the reactions of other people. Other bystanders' interpretation of an emergency influences perception of the incident and helping behavior. In one study, diffusion of responsibility does not occur if another bystander is perceived as being unable to help.\nGroup psychology can also influence behaviour positively; in the event that one bystander takes responsibility for the situation and takes specific action, other bystanders are more likely to follow course. This is a positive example of the usually-pejorative herd mentality. Thus, the presence of bystanders affects individual helping behaviour by processes of social influence and diffusion of responsibility.\n\n\n### Moral disengagement\nDiffusion of responsibility can negatively affect personal morals. With diffusion of responsibility, it has been found that people feel less accountable for their work. This lack of accountability can be because labour is divided amongst members in a group and so no one member feels an overwhelming amount of responsibility for their organisation or their overall project. It has been found that many members get narrowed into focusing on their individual work, that they eventually forget about any moral aspects. Purely focusing on the functional aspects of their jobs is a result of division of labour, which is a mechanism for diffusion of responsibility. This can be highly concerning for organisations since division of labour is a common practice amongst many.\nMoral disengagement is likely to be particularly important in organisations because bureaucratic structures and the division of labour seem to lend themselves to moral disengagement mechanisms such as the diffusion and displacement of responsibility. Euphemistic labelling is also common in organisations, such as when managers refer to layoffs as \u201crightsizing.\u201d Also, with victims out of sight, globalization makes it easier to ignore or distort the harmful consequences of business actions. Thus, moral disengagement seems highly relevant to understanding unethical behaviour in 21st century organizations.\n\n\n### Risk-taking behaviour\nThe risky-shift effect (see groupshift) is the increased likelihood for a group to support or partake in a risky decision or action. Larger groups permit a wider responsibility diffusion than the groups of two or three. As group size increases, the likelihood also increases that the group contains at least one highly risky and influential member who would be able to win over all the others. This demonstrates how larger group size and the increased riskiness of one person can cause the diffusion of responsibility from all group members to only the decisive, risk-taking member. From the group-processes standpoint, then, the risky-shift effect becomes stronger as the groups grow larger. And it has been proved by various studies that the risky-shift effect is more pronounced the larger the size of the group.\nIn risk-taking literature, diffusion of responsibility occurs when individual members of a group feel less personal responsibility for potential failure in the pursuit of risky options than if acting alone.\nSuch risky shift is a stable phenomenon that has been shown in experiments involving group discussion and consensus. For example, a study using risks and payoffs based on monetary gain and loss for problem-solving performance found a greater percentage of shift\u2014hence, increased risk taking in group decision making.\nOther research suggests that risky shifts can also be attributed to group polarization, majority rules, interpersonal comparisons, informational influence, and familiarisation. Like diffusion of responsibility in emergency situations, the larger the size of the group during conditions of discussion and information exchange, the greater the risky shift.\n\n\n### Bystander effect\nRising from the unfortunate case of Catherine \"Kitty\" Genovese, the bystander effect is a psychological notion that came to light in the 1960s. Catherine Genovese's case seems to cast a predominantly daunting light on human behavior. The event highlights the lessening of the likelihood of a person taking immediate action in a certain situation while part of a group or around other people.\nDarley and Latan\u00e9 (1968) performed a study that viewed whether the presence of other bystanders would affect the likelihood and speed of which the subjects would respond to hearing another subject (a confederate) having a seizure. The subjects either believed they were in a two-person group, three-person group, or a six-person group.  The researchers concluded that subjects were less likely to help the greater the number of bystanders, demonstrating the bystander effect.\nThe bystander effect is a specific type of diffusion of responsibility\u2014when people's responses to certain situations depend on the presence of others. The bystander effect occurs when multiple individuals are watching a situation unfold but do not intervene (or delay or hesitate to intervene) because they know that someone else could intervene, and they feel less responsibility to do so. This is directly caused by the diffusion of responsibility, as it is shown that individuals are much less likely to intervene in a situation when he or she knows others are watching; thus, the responsibility for helping is spread among the group of bystanders, and each bystander does not feel a strong responsibility to do so, so no one helps.\nHowever, it has been shown that people's responses and levels of aid can change depending on the type of situation (emergencies versus non-emergencies) as well.\n\n\n## See also\n\nAutomation bias\nBanality of evil\nCollective responsibility\nCrowd psychology\nDesign by committee\nLittle Eichmanns\nMilgram experiment\nNuremberg Defense\nResponsibility assignment matrix\nSomebody else's problem\nTragedy of the commons\nTeam error\nOmission bias\n\n\n## References\n\n\n\n## External links\n\n",

      "text": "# Digital_infinity\n\nDigital infinity is a technical term in theoretical linguistics. Alternative formulations are \"discrete infinity\" and \"the infinite use of finite means\". The idea is that all human languages follow a simple logical principle, according to which a limited set of digits\u2014irreducible atomic sound elements\u2014are combined to produce an infinite range of potentially meaningful expressions. \n\nLanguage is, at its core, a system that is both digital and infinite. To my knowledge, there is no other biological system with these properties....\nIt remains for us to examine the spiritual element of speech ... this marvelous invention of composing from twenty-five or thirty sounds an infinite variety of words, which, although not having any resemblance in themselves to that which passes through our minds, nevertheless do not fail to reveal to others all of the secrets of the mind, and to make intelligible to others who cannot penetrate into the mind all that we conceive and all of the diverse movements of our souls.\nNoam Chomsky cites Galileo as perhaps the first to recognise the significance of digital infinity. This principle, notes Chomsky, is \"the core property of human language, and one of its most distinctive properties: the use of finite means to express an unlimited array of thoughts\". In his Dialogo, Galileo describes with wonder the discovery of a means to communicate one's \"most secret thoughts to any other person ... with no greater difficulty than the various collocations of twenty-four little characters upon a paper.\" \"This is the greatest of all human inventions,\" Galileo continues, noting it to be \"comparable to the creations of a Michelangelo\".\n\n\n## The computational theory of mind\n\n'Digital infinity' corresponds to Noam Chomsky's 'universal grammar' mechanism, conceived as a computational module inserted somehow into Homo sapiens' otherwise 'messy' (non-digital) brain. This conception of human cognition\u2014central to the so-called 'cognitive revolution' of the 1950s and 1960s\u2014is generally attributed to Alan Turing, who was the first scientist to argue that a man-made machine might truly be said to 'think'. But his often forgotten conclusion however was in line with previous observations that a \"thinking\" machine would be absurd, since we have no formal idea what \"thinking\" is \u2014 and indeed we still don't. Chomsky frequently pointed this out. Chomsky agreed that while a mind can be said to \"compute\"\u2014as we have some idea of what computing is and some good evidence the brain is doing it on at least some level\u2014we cannot however claim that a computer or any other machine is \"thinking\" because we have no coherent definition of what thinking is. Taking the example of what's called 'consciousness,' Chomsky said that, \"We don't even have bad theories\"\u2014echoing the famous physics criticism that a theory is \"not even wrong.\" From Turing's seminal 1950 article, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", published in Mind, Chomsky provides the example of a submarine being said to \"swim.\" Turing clearly derided the idea. \"If you want to call that swimming, fine,\" Chomsky says, repeatedly explaining in print and video how Turing is consistently misunderstood on this, one of his most cited observations.\nPreviously the idea of a thinking machine was famously dismissed by Ren\u00e9 Descartes as theoretically impossible. Neither animals nor machines can think, insisted Descartes, since they lack a God-given soul. Turing was well aware of this traditional theological objection, and explicitly countered it. \nToday's digital computers are instantiations of Turing's theoretical breakthrough in conceiving the possibility of a man-made universal thinking machine\u2014known nowadays as a 'Turing machine'. No physical mechanism can be intrinsically 'digital', Turing explained, since\u2014examined closely enough\u2014its possible states will vary without limit. But if most of these states can be profitably ignored, leaving only a limited set of relevant distinctions, then functionally the machine may be considered 'digital': \n\nThe digital computers considered in the last section may be classified amongst the \"discrete-state machines.\" These are the machines which move by sudden jumps or clicks from one quite definite state to another. These states are sufficiently different for the possibility of confusion between them to be ignored. Strictly speaking, there are no such machines. Everything really moves continuously. But there are many kinds of machine which can profitably be thought of as being discrete-state machines. For instance in considering the switches for a lighting system it is a convenient fiction that each switch must be definitely on or definitely off. There must be intermediate positions, but for most purposes we can forget about them. \nAn implication is that 'digits' don't exist: they and their combinations are no more than convenient fictions, operating on a level quite independent of the material, physical world. In the case of a binary digital machine, the choice at each point is restricted to 'off' versus 'on'. Crucially, the intrinsic properties of the medium used to encode signals then have no effect on the message conveyed. 'Off' (or alternatively 'on') remains unchanged regardless of whether the signal consists of smoke, electricity, sound, light or anything else. In the case of analog (more-versus-less) gradations, this is not so because the range of possible settings is unlimited. Moreover, in the analog case it does matter which particular medium is being employed: equating a certain intensity of smoke with a corresponding intensity of light, sound or electricity is just not possible. In other words, only in the case of digital computation and communication can information be truly independent of the physical, chemical or other properties of the materials used to encode and transmit messages.\nThis way, digital computation and communication operates independently of the physical properties of the computing machine. As scientists and philosophers during the 1950s digested the implications, they exploited the insight to explain why 'mind' apparently operates on so different a level from 'matter'. Descartes's celebrated distinction between immortal 'soul' and mortal 'body' was conceptualised, following Turing, as no more than the distinction between (digitally encoded) information on the one hand, and, on the other, the particular physical medium\u2014light, sound, electricity or whatever\u2014chosen to transmit the corresponding signals. Note that the Cartesian assumption of mind's independence of matter implied\u2014in the human case at least\u2014the existence of some kind of digital computer operating inside the human brain. \n\nInformation and computation reside in patterns of data and in relations of logic that are independent of the physical medium that carries them. When you telephone your mother in another city, the message stays the same as it goes from your lips to her ears even as it physically changes its form, from vibrating air, to electricity in a wire, to charges in silicon, to flickering light in a fibre optic cable, to electromagnetic waves, and then back again in reverse order. ... Likewise, a given programme can run on computers made of vacuum tubes, electromagnetic switches, transistors, integrated circuits, or well-trained pigeons, and it accomplishes the same things for the same reasons.\nThis insight, first expressed by the mathematician Alan Turing, the computer scientists Alan Newell, Herbert Simon, and Marvin Minsky, and the philosophers Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor, is now called the computational theory of mind. It is one of the great ideas in intellectual history, for it solves one of the puzzles that make up the 'mind-body problem', how to connect the ethereal world of meaning and intention, the stuff of our mental lives, with a physical hunk of matter like the brain. ... For millennia this has been a paradox. ... The computational theory of mind resolves the paradox.\n\n\n## A digital apparatus\n\nTuring did not claim that the human mind really is a digital computer. More modestly, he proposed that digital computers might one day qualify in human eyes as machines endowed with \"mind\". However, it was not long before philosophers (most notably Hilary Putnam) took what seemed to be the next logical step\u2014arguing that the human mind itself is a digital computer, or at least that certain mental \"modules\" are best understood that way.\nNoam Chomsky rose to prominence as one of the most audacious champions of this 'cognitive revolution'. Language, he proposed, is a computational 'module' or 'device' unique to the human brain. Previously, linguists had thought of language as learned cultural behaviour: chaotically variable, inseparable from social life and therefore beyond the remit of natural science. The Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, for example, had defined linguistics as a branch of 'semiotics', this in turn being inseparable from anthropology, sociology and the study of man-made conventions and institutions. By picturing language instead as the natural mechanism of 'digital infinity', Chomsky promised to bring scientific rigour to linguistics as a branch of strictly natural science.\n\nIn the 1950s, phonology was generally considered the most rigorously scientific branch of linguistics. For phonologists, \"digital infinity\" was made possible by the human vocal apparatus conceptualised as a kind of machine consisting of a small number of binary switches. For example, \"voicing\" could be switched 'on' or 'off', as could palatisation, nasalisation and so forth. Take the consonant [b], for example, and switch voicing to the 'off' position\u2014and you get [p]. Every possible phoneme in any of the world's languages might in this way be generated by specifying a particular on/off configuration of the switches ('articulators') constituting the human vocal apparatus. This approach became celebrated as 'distinctive features' theory, in large part credited to the Russian linguist and polymath Roman Jakobson. The basic idea was that every phoneme in every natural language could in principle be reduced to its irreducible atomic components\u2014a set of 'on' or 'off' choices ('distinctive features') allowed by the design of a digital apparatus consisting of the human tongue, soft palate, lips, larynx and so forth. \nChomsky's original work was in morphophonemics. During the 1950s, he became inspired by the prospect of extending Roman Jakobson's 'distinctive features' approach\u2014now hugely successful\u2014far beyond its original field of application. Jakobson had already persuaded a young social anthropologist\u2014Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss\u2014to apply distinctive features theory to the study of kinship systems, in this way inaugurating 'structural anthropology'. Chomsky\u2014who got his job at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology thanks to the intervention of Jakobson and his student, Morris Halle\u2014hoped to explore the extent to which similar principles might be applied to the various sub-disciplines of linguistics, including syntax and semantics. If the phonological component of language was demonstrably rooted in a digital biological 'organ' or 'device', why not the syntactic and semantic components as well? Might not language as a whole prove to be a digital organ or device?\nThis led some of Chomsky's early students to the idea of 'generative semantics'\u2014the proposal that the speaker generates word and sentence meanings by combining irreducible constituent elements of meaning, each of which can be switched 'on' or 'off'. To produce 'bachelor', using this logic, the relevant component of the brain must switch 'animate', 'human' and 'male' to the 'on' (+) position while keeping 'married' switched 'off' (-). The underlying assumption here is that the requisite conceptual primitives\u2014irreducible notions such as 'animate', 'male', 'human', 'married' and so forth\u2014are genetically determined internal components of the human language organ. This idea would rapidly encounter intellectual difficulties\u2014sparking controversies culminating in the so-called 'linguistics wars' as described in Randy Allen Harris's 1993 publication by that name. The linguistic wars attracted young and ambitious scholars impressed by the recent emergence of computer science and its promise of scientific parsimony and unification. If the theory worked, the simple principle of digital infinity would apply to language as a whole. Linguistics in its entirety might then lay claim to the coveted status of natural science. No part of the discipline\u2014not even semantics\u2014need be \"contaminated\" any longer by association with such 'un-scientific' disciplines as cultural anthropology or social science.\n\n\n## See also\n\nDecoding Chomsky\nGenerative linguistics\n\"The Library of Babel\"\nOrigin of language\nOrigin of speech\nRecursion\n\n\n## References\n\n\n\n## Further reading\n\n",

      "text": "# Discursive_psychology\n\nDiscursive psychology (DP) is a form of discourse analysis that focuses on psychological themes in talk, text, and images.\nAs a counter to mainstream psychology's treatment of discourse as a \"mirror\" for people's expressions of thoughts, intentions, motives, etc., DP's founders made the case for picturing it instead as a \"construction yard\" wherein all such presumptively prior and independent notions of thought and so on were built from linguistic materials, topicalised and, in various less direct ways, handled and managed. Here, the study of the psychological implies commitment not to the inner life of the mind, but rather, to the written and spoken practices within which people invoked, implicitly or explicitly, notions precisely like \"the inner life of the mind\". Discursive psychology therefore starts with psychological phenomena as things that are constructed, attended to, and understood in interaction. An evaluation, say, may be constructed using particular phrases and idioms, responded to by the recipient (as a compliment perhaps) and treated as the expression of a strong position. In discursive psychology, the focus is not on psychological matters somehow leaking out into interaction; rather, interaction is the primary site where psychological issues are live. It is philosophically opposed to more traditional cognitivist approaches to language. It uses studies of naturally occurring conversation to critique the way that topics have been conceptualised and treated in psychology.\n\n\n## History\n\nThe origins of what is now termed \"discursive psychology\" can arguably be traced to the late 1980s, and the collaborative research and analysis sessions that took place as part of Loughborough University's then newly formed Discourse and Rhetoric Group (DARG). A key landmark was the publication of Jonathan Potter and Margaret Wetherell's classic text Discourse and social psychology: Beyond attitudes and behaviour in 1987. Charles Antaki, writing in the Times Higher Education Supplement, described the impact of this book:\n\nPotter and Wetherell have genuinely presented us with a different way of working in social psychology. The book's clarity means that it has the power to influence a lot of people ill-at-ease with traditional social psychology but unimpressed with (or simply bewildered by) other alternatives on offer. It could rescue social psychology from the sterility of the laboratory and its traditional mentalism.\nThe field itself was originally labeled as DP during the early 1990s by Derek Edwards and Potter at Loughborough University. It has since been developed and extended by a number of others, including (but by no means limited to): Charles Antaki, Malcolm Ashmore, Frederick Attenborough, Bethan Benwell, Steve Brown, Carly Butler, Derek Edwards, Alexa Hepburn, Eric Laurier, Hedwig te Molder, Sue Speer, Liz Stokoe, Cristian Tileaga, Sally Wiggins and Sue Wilkinson. Discursive psychology draws on the philosophy of mind of Gilbert Ryle and the later Ludwig Wittgenstein, the rhetorical approach of Michael Billig, the ethnomethodology of Harold Garfinkel, the conversation analysis of Harvey Sacks and the sociology of scientific knowledge of those like Mike Mulkay, Steve Woolgar and Bruno Latour. The term \"discursive psychology\" was designed partly to indicate that there was not just a methodological shift at work in this form of analysis, but also, and at the same time, that it involved some fairly radical theoretical rethinking.\n\n\n## Study\n\nDiscursive psychology conducts studies of both naturally occurring and experimentally engineered human interaction that offer new ways of understanding topics in social and cognitive psychology such as memory, identity and attitude. Although discursive psychology subscribes to a different view of human mentality than is advanced by mainstream psychology, Edwards and Potter's work was originally motivated by their dissatisfaction with how psychology had treated discourse. In many psychological studies, the things people (subjects) say are treated as windows (with varying degrees of opacity) into their minds. Talk is seen as (and, in experimental psychology and protocol analysis, used as) descriptions of people's mental content. In contrast, discursive psychology treats talk as social action; that is, we say what we do as a means of, and in the course of, doing things in a socially meaningful world. Thus, the questions that it makes sense to ask also change.\n\n\n## DP-in-action: an illustration\n\nDP can be illustrated with an example from Edwards' research on script formulations. Traditional social psychology treats scripts as mentally encoded templates that guide action. Discursive psychology focuses on the foundational issue of how a description is built to present a course of action as following from a standardized routine. Take the following example from a couple counselling session (the transcription symbols here were developed by Gail Jefferson). The Counsellor says: \"before you moved over here how was the marriage\". After a delay of about half a second, Connie, the wife who is being jointly counselled, replies \"Oh to me all along, right up to now, my marriage was rock solid. Rock solid = We had arguments like everybody else had arguments, but to me there was no major problems.\" One thing that discursive psychologists would be interested in would be the way that Connie depicts the arguments that she and her partner have as the routine kind of arguments that everybody has. While arguments might be thought as a problem with a marriage, Connie \"script formulates\" them as actually characteristic of a \"rock solid\" marriage. Action and interaction is accomplished as orderly in interactions of this kind. Discursive psychology focuses on the locally organized practices for constructing the world to serve relevant activities (in this case managing the live question of who is to blame and who needs to change in the counselling). In the discursive psychological vision, scripts are an inseparable part of the practical and moral world of accountability.\n\n\n## Applications of DP: spoken and textual approaches\n\nIn the past few years, one particular strand of discursive psychology has focused its analytic gaze on spoken interaction. As a consequence, it has relied heavily on (but also contributed to the development of) the principles and practices of conversation analysis. Focusing on material drawn from real world situations such as relationship counselling, child protection helplines, neighbour disputes and family mealtimes, it has asked questions such as: How does a party in relationship counselling construct the problem as something that the other party needs to work on? How does a child protection officer working on a child protection helpline manage the possibly competing tasks of soothing a crying caller and simultaneously eliciting evidence sufficient for social services to intervene to help an abused child? And what makes a parent's request to a child to eat different from a directive, and different in turn from a threat?\nAlthough most recent DP oriented studies take talk-in-interaction as their primary data, it is not difficult to locate another strand of DP-related research in which texts are approached as sites for the active literary/narratorial management of matters such as agency, intent, doubt, culpability, belief, prejudice, and so on. One of the founding studies for this kind of textual approach was \"Who killed the Princess? Description and Blame in the British Print Press\" by Derek Edwards and Katie MacMillan. The \"generally applicable discourse analytic approach\" articulated and demonstrated therein has proved particularly useful for the study of media texts. Whereas traditional DP studies explore the situated, occasioned, rhetorical use of our rich common sense psychological lexicon across various forms of spoken data, this newer form of textual DP shows that and how authors use that same lexicon in order to present themselves (or others) as individuals and/or members of larger collectives that are (ab)normal, (ir)rational, (un)reasonable, etc. This approach has proved particularly productive in an age marked by the growth in usage of social media, SMS texts, photo messaging apps, blogs/vlogs, YouTube, interactive websites (etc.): never before have so many opportunities for explicitly public, accountably interactional and rhetorically motivated invocations of psychological terms been available to so many people.\n\n\n## See also\n\nCritical discourse analysis\nDiscursive complex\nMediated stylistics\nOrdinary language philosophy\nPostcognitivism\nStylistics (field of study)\n\n\n## References\n\n\n\n## Bibliography\n\nClassic texts\nEdwards, D (1997) Discourse and Cognition.

      "text": "# Displacement_(psychology)\n\nIn psychology, displacement (German: Verschiebung, lit.\u2009'shift, move') is an unconscious defence mechanism whereby the mind substitutes either a new aim or a new object for things felt in their original form to be dangerous or unacceptable.\nExample: if your boss criticizes you at work, you might feel angry but cannot express it directly to your boss. Instead, when you get home, you take out your frustration by yelling at a family member or slamming a door. Here, the family member or the door is a safer target for your anger than your boss.\n\n\n## Freud\n\nThe concept of displacement originated with Sigmund Freud. Initially he saw it as a means of dream-distortion, involving a shift of emphasis from important to unimportant elements, or the replacement of something by a mere illusion. Freud called this \u201cdisplacement of accent.\u201d  \nDisplacement of object: Feelings that are connected with one person are displaced onto another person. A man who has had a bad day at the office, comes home and yells at his wife and children, is displacing his anger from the workplace onto his family. Freud thought that when children have animal phobias, they may be displacing fears of their parents onto an animal. \nDisplacement of attribution: A characteristic that one perceives in oneself but seems unacceptable is instead attributed to another person. This is essentially the mechanism of psychological projection; an aspect of the self is projected (displaced) onto someone else. Freud wrote that people commonly displace their own desires onto God\u2019s will. \nBodily displacements: A genital sensation may be experienced in the mouth (displacement upward) or an oral sensation may be experienced in the genitals (displacement downward). Novelist John Cleland in Fanny Hill referred to the vagina as \u201cthe nethermouth.\u201d Sexual attraction toward a human body can be displaced in sexual fetishism, sometimes onto a particular body part like the foot, or at other times onto an inanimate fetish object. \nFreud also saw displacement as occurring in jokes, as well as in neuroses \u2013 the obsessional neurotic being especially prone to the technique of displacement onto the minute. When two or more displacements occur towards the same idea, the phenomenon is called condensation (from the German Verdichtung).\nPhobia displacement or repression: Humans were able to express specific unconscious needs through phobias. These needs that were suppressed deep within themselves created anxiety and tension. The stress, fear, and anxiety that characterize a phobic disorder were the discharge.\nReaction formation: Cognizant practices are embraced to overcompensate for the nervousness an individual feels in regards to their socially inadmissible oblivious considerations or feelings. Typically, a response arrangement is set apart by misrepresented conduct, like garishness and urgency. An illustration of reaction formation incorporates the loyal little girl who adores her mom is responding to her Oedipus scorn of her mom. \n\n\n## The psychoanalytic mainstream\n\nAmong Freud's mainstream followers, Otto Fenichel highlighted the displacement of affect, either through postponement or by redirection, or both. More broadly, he considered that \"in part the paths of displacement depend on the nature of the drives that are warded off\".\nFreud's daughter, Anna Freud, also played an important role in the upbringing of these defense mechanisms by the twentieth century. She introduced and analyzed ten of her own defense mechanisms and her work has been used and increased through the years by newer psychoanalysts.\nEric Berne in his first, psychoanalytic work, maintained that \"some of the most interesting and socially useful displacements of libido occur when both the aim and the object are partial substitutions for the biological aim and object...sublimation\".\n\n\n## Lacan\n\nIn 1957, psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, inspired by an article by linguist Roman Jakobson on metaphor and metonymy, argued that the unconscious has the structure of a language, linking displacement to the poetic function of metonymy, and condensation to that of metaphor.\nAs Lacan put it, \"in the case of Verschiebung, 'displacement', the German term is closer to the idea of that veering off of signification that we see in metonymy, and which from its first appearance in Freud is represented as the most appropriate means used by the unconscious to foil censorship\".\n\n\n## Aggression\n\n\nWithin the Freudian psychoanalytic framework, the aggressive drives may be displaced in a similar manner to the libidinal drives. Business or athletic competition, or hunting, for instance, may offer opportunities for the expression of displaced aggression. In such scapegoating behavior, aggression may be displaced onto items or people with little to no connection to the cause of the aggressors' frustration. \nDisplacement can also act in what looks like a 'chain reaction,' with people unwittingly becoming both victims and perpetrators of displacement. For example, a man is angry with his boss, but he cannot express this properly, so he hits his wife. The wife, in turn, hits one of the children, possibly disguising this as a \"punishment.\" (rationalization)\nEgo psychology sought to use displacement in child rearing, a dummy being used as a displaced target for toddler sibling rivalry. With a purpose to apprehend how the ego uses defense mechanisms, it is important to apprehend the defense mechanisms themselves and the way they function. A few defense mechanisms are visible as protecting us from the internal impulses (e.g., repression); other defense mechanisms guard us from external threats (e.g., denial). \n\n\n## Transferential displacement\n\nThe displacement of feelings and attitudes from past significant others onto the present-day ones constitutes a central aspect of the transference, particularly in the case of the neurotic.\nA subsidiary form of displacement within the transference occurs when the patient disguises transference references by applying them to an apparent third party or to themself.\nAs of now encoded in subcortical neural pathways, material from our oblivious brain is pushed into our cognizant psyche as we attempt to manage mental wonders \u2013 typically agonizing \u2013 that we are encountering. With the \"help\" of mind movement, we unknowingly re-surface and re-order struggle-ridden encounters as though the past were the present and one setting were another. We move contemplations, sentiments, and perspectives, particularly about individuals who take after others. We allocate them jobs once played by others. We take on old jobs ourselves. All unwittingly. \n\n\n## Criticism\n\nLater writers have objected that whereas Freud only described the displacement of sex into culture, for example, the converse \u2013 social conflict being displaced into sexuality \u2013 is also true.\nFreud's hypothesis is acceptable at clarifying however not at anticipating conduct. Therefore, Freud's hypothesis is unfalsifiable - it cannot be demonstrated valid or invalidated. Freud may likewise have shown research predisposition in his understandings - he may just focused on data which upheld his hypotheses, and overlooked data and different clarifications that didn't fit them.\n\n\n## See also\n\n\n\n## References\n\n\n\n## Further reading\n\nArthur J.
