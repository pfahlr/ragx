      "text": "# Splitting_(psychology)\n\nSplitting, also called binary thinking, dichotomous thinking, black-and-white thinking, all-or-nothing thinking, or thinking in extremes, is the failure in a person's thinking to bring together the dichotomy of both perceived positive and negative qualities of something into a cohesive, realistic whole. It is a common defense mechanism, wherein the individual tends to think in extremes (e.g., an individual's actions and motivations are all good or all bad with no middle ground). This kind of dichotomous interpretation is contrasted by an acknowledgement of certain nuances known as \"shades of gray\". Splitting can include different contexts, as individuals who use this defense mechanism may \"split\" representations of their own mind, of their own personality, and of others. Splitting is observed in Cluster B personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder, as well as schizophrenia and depression. In dissociative identity disorder, the term splitting is used to refer to a split in personality alters.\nSplitting was first described by Ronald Fairbairn in his formulation of object relations theory in 1952; it begins as the inability of the infant to combine the fulfilling aspects of the parents (the good object) and their unresponsive aspects (the unsatisfying object) into the same individuals, instead seeing the good and bad as separate. In psychoanalytic theory this functions as a defense mechanism. Splitting was also described by Hyppolyte Taine in 1878 who described splitting as a splitting of the ego. He described this as the existence of two thoughts, wills, distinct actions simultaneously within an individual who is aware of one mind without the awareness of the other.\n\n\n## Mechanism\n\nSplitting people, ideas, and things into categories of either good or bad can be typically seen in childhood development, but \"is expected to recede once the child has developed the capacity to understand primary caretakers as simultaneously possessing both good and bad qualities.\"\nThe individual will often perceive something that contradicts with their image of themselves or a person close to them as a rejection or slight, a perceived attempt to isolate or abandon them, or even a feeling of unwanted attraction. Psychoanalysis theories propose the idea that idealization and devaluation means there is polarization in not only an individual's self model but their perceived view of others as well.\nIndividuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) have even been shown to interpret social acceptance as subterfuge or deception. They have also been shown to be less sensitive to verbal irony due to a negative bias in interpreting ambiguous information. Individuals diagnosed with BPD may also believe that they will be abandoned if they trust anyone around them.\nThe individual will feel challenged by this discomfort as it relates to their self perception and will form a narrative to explain and externalize the perceived discomfort, making it wholly the fault of another. Proneness to rejection hypersensitivity, problems in establishing and maintaining consistent and appropriate levels of trust in interpersonal relationships, and frequent misinterpretation of social signals contribute greatly to a subject with BPD's ability to find supporting \"evidence\" for their devaluation process. This can be exacerbated in times of professional or personal stress as stress induced paranoia is a recognized diagnostic feature of BPD. Splitting can also result in dispositional and situational attributes of others' actions. This means that both a liked person's good behavior and an unliked person's bad behavior are both dispositional attributes; however, a good person's bad behavior would be situational and attributed to symptoms like stress or intoxication.\nThe individual will then devalue the person that they once idealised. Often then the splitting process becomes behavioural and the subject will often abruptly lash out or cut contact with the person that they devalued causing a great deal of inner group conflict and distress. In order to prevent perceived judgement from others, the subject will often engage in a stage of justification of their actions by convincing those around them of the validity of their claims that the devalued party is entirely bad and that they are purely a victim.\nWith people with Cluster B personality disorders, this often involves the embellishment or invention of grievances that garner an emotional response from those around them that they feel matches their own distress at the situation. The more valuable the social bond they are trying to preserve or the higher their general need for social acceptance, the higher the probability that they engage in psychologically abusive behaviour. This can cause intense psychological distress in the person they are devaluing and can be met by legal challenges of abuse or slander.\nSplitting also impacts self-esteem, as the dichotomous good or bad thinking is applied to an individual's own self image and how they perceive themselves.\n\n\n## Management\n\nFor the loved ones of those with BPD there are several seemingly contradictory factors to balance:\n\nPrivacy of the subject versus seeking external help.\nAcknowledging the subject's emotions while not endorsing or encouraging their behaviour.\nHelping the subject navigate their episode while not protecting from the consequences of their actions.\nThe New England Personality Disorder Association recommends always involving the wider group in the discussion of issues, not responding to or ignoring threats or accusations (even if untrue) in the moment then discussing the episode in an open and realistic manner when the subject has calmed, and never protecting the subject from social or legal consequences of their actions.\nCertain difficulties arise from validating emotions and not endorsing the behaviour of splitting as the loved one of the person with BPD risks becoming both complicit in problematic behaviours and reinforcing them.\nExamples provided by Gunderson and Berkowitz are:\n\nIf the subject were to steal from someone they believe owes them money, it is not appropriate to shield them from prosecution.\nIf the subject attacks another inappropriately (either physically or verbally), it is not appropriate to condone this behaviour in order to avoid conflict.\nAlthough BPD was thought to be untreatable in the past, many new forms of therapy have been studied, practiced, and have been shown to help in the management and treatment of this disorder.\nDialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is the most known treatment for those with BPD who did not thrive in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This type of therapy proposes that those with BPD can more effectively manage their interactions with others by acquiring skills that better help them deal with stress, regulate emotions, and have quality relationships. This therapy includes one weekly hour of individual therapy, a two-hour group training session, communication outside of sessions, and a consultation team created for the therapist.\nMentalization-based treatment (MBT) is a therapy that proposes that symptoms in individuals with BPD form when the patient stops mentalizing, meaning they stop rationally thinking about the emotions in their own minds and others' minds. This leads individuals to disconnect from reality and operate from the certainty they feel about others' motives. MBT strengthens an individual's capability to operate under attachment stress. Therapists encourage patients to dig into their emotional and unrealistic thoughts and actions in a more grounded and open mindset and thought process. MBT encourages individuals to think in a hyperactive state of mind within themselves instead of the internalized insights that they create of the world. This therapy includes 50 weekly minutes of individual therapy, 75 minutes of in group therapy, and a team meeting reflecting over how team members are doing with their mentalization.\nTransference focused psychotherapy is a therapy that focuses on the interpersonal dynamics of the lives of individuals and what happens during their emotional states. Their interpersonal dynamic is brought out during therapy and later studied to resolve what the good and bad splits may affect an individuals personal lives. This mechanism helps individuals reach a more balanced way of thinking about themselves and about others. Transference therapy involves two therapy sessions each week without the presence of group therapy.\nSchema-focused therapy is a type of cognitive therapy that focuses on structural changes that may occur in an individual's life. This involves two weekly therapy sessions in which the therapist administers behavioral, experimental, and cognitive practices that focus on the individual's everyday life and activities that occur within it including any past traumatic experiences that may have occurred. This therapy works by changing the individual's way of negative thinking and believing into a healthier more functional way of thinking.\nGeneral psychiatric management focuses on individuals' lives outside of whatever therapy they may receive. It prioritizes their ability to function normally in their relationships and in their social functioning. By discussing an individual's symptoms and prognosis, therapists can create a plan for treatment. General management normally does not involve more than one weekly session and has a goal to improve functionality by putting an individual in their everyday lives with the expectation that they will work on their coping by themselves.\n\n\n## Relationships\n\nSplitting creates instability in relationships because one person can be viewed as either personified virtue or personified vice at different times, depending on whether they gratify the subject's needs or frustrate them. This, along with similar oscillations in the experience and appraisal of the self, leads to chaotic and unstable relationship patterns, identity diffusion, and mood swings. The therapeutic process can be greatly impeded by these oscillations because the therapist too can come to be seen as all good or all bad. To attempt to overcome the negative effects on treatment outcomes, constant interpretations by the therapist are needed.\nSplitting contributes to unstable relationships and intense emotional experiences. Splitting is common during adolescence, but is regarded as transient. It has been noted especially in persons diagnosed with BPD. Treatment strategies have been developed for individuals and groups based on DBT, and for couples. There are also self-help books on related topics such as mindfulness and emotional regulation that claim to be helpful for individuals who struggle with the consequences of splitting. The fear of incurring the social consequences of splitting has been theorised to lead people with BPD to avoid social or romantic relationships with those they perceive to be critical and/or prone to assertive or aggressive behaviour and conversely seek out individuals they perceive to be passive.\nMany in relationships with individuals who struggle with splitting have stated that they feel as though they \"tip-toe\" through their relationship because there is a constant sense of duty and worrying that their partner will split and begin to see them as the \"bad guy\". Individuals have expressed the need to consistently validate and make sure their partner is understood due to their struggles with interpersonal identity and lack of self-worth. Hypersensitivity is one feature of BPD that caused individuals to both idolize and devalue the people they surround themselves with due to their fear of rejection. This is also expressed by an individual's need for intimacy followed by a fear of rejection and interpersonal aggression. Interpersonal rejection is a split response to the feeling of rejection that an individual may feel which can result in problems within friendships and relationships because of a disruption in an individual's interpersonal functioning.\n\n\n## Disorders\n\n\n\n### Autism spectrum disorder\n\nDichotomous or black and white thinking is a common feature of autism spectrum disorder.\n\n\n### Borderline personality disorder\n\nSplitting is a relatively common defense mechanism for people with borderline personality disorder (BPD). One of the DSM IV-TR criteria for this disorder is a description of splitting: \"a pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation\". In psychoanalytic theory, people with BPD are not able to integrate the good and bad images of both self and others, resulting in a bad representation which dominates the good representation.\nPeople with BPD are especially prone to splitting, causing the breakdown of social relationships, as they often seek positions of control in social situations, are hypersensitive to criticism, are prone to paranoia, and have an intense need for social acceptance. Additionally, they often have \"domineering, intrusive, and vindictive styles of relating to others correlated with perpetrating psychological aggression\", thus reducing their ability to resolve conflicts amicably.\nIn CBT, the instability that characterizes BPD is seen to come from patterns of thoughts, feelings, and memories that are maladaptive. The back and forth splitting of idealization and devaluation is a unique feature of BPD and NPD. Splitting may cause individuals to believe that they will be abused if they put trust in someone which can result in a simplistic view of how other people think and act. It is also seen as an over simplistic way that individuals with BPD interpret the motives that others may have when it comes to themselves and their well-being.\n\n\n### Narcissistic personality disorder\n\nPeople matching the diagnostic criteria for narcissistic personality disorder also use splitting as a central defense mechanism. Most often narcissists do this as an attempt to stabilize their sense of self-positivity in order to preserve their self-esteem, by perceiving themselves as purely upright or admirable and others who do not conform to their will or values as purely wicked or contemptible.\nThe cognitive habit of splitting also implies the use of other related defense mechanisms, namely idealization and devaluation, which are preventive attitudes or reactions to narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury.  The heightened sense of self idealization in splitting can create an inflated sense of self where individuals view themselves as doing no wrong and placing all blame and aggression on others.\nThe main components of narcissistic personality disorder includes an extreme sensitivity to criticism due to their \"do no wrong\" ideas of self, developing a sense of entitlement compared to those around them, issues within their relationship lives, feeling like they are unique and different, a developed need to be admired by those around them, a lack of empathy, and a lack of impulse and anger control. These characteristics can cause someone with NPD to split at any time with either one or all characteristics simultaneously based on who they are around at the time and how they interpret the way they are being treated.\n\n\n### Schizophrenia\n\nIn schizophrenia, the term splitting is described as mental fragmentation or a loosening of their mental associations. They are shown to have a lower ability to retrieve information solely from memory and make slower physical and mental decisions. Splitting in schizophrenia is likely related to a decrease in amygdala activity and a lack of control of the prefrontal cortex which may reflect an inability to express feelings and emotions.\nUnlike BPD and NPD, splitting in schizophrenia is not characterized by a split of the ego like thoughts of all good or all bad, grandiosity, or a sense of entitlement. Instead, splitting in schizophrenia is characterized by a split of consciousness in which an individual may exhibit psychopathological manifestations due to their decreased mental tensions and inhibited brain activity. This can also lead to individuals integrating their memories which is where their brain activities and memory combine and overlap that creates memories that are made up of one another.\n\n\n### Depression\n\nAs a defense mechanism, the tendency to split may also indicate signs of depression. In depression, exaggerated all-or-nothing thinking can form a self-reinforcing cycle: these thoughts might be called emotional amplifiers because, as they go around and around, they become more intense. Typical all-or-nothing thoughts:\n\nMy efforts are either a success or they are an abject failure.\nOther people are either all good or all bad.\nI am either all good or all bad.\nIf you're not with us, you're against us.\n\n\n### Dissociative identity disorder\n\nIn dissociative identity disorder, a split refers to the creation of distinct personality alters. The development of alters in DID is related to extreme traumatization, in which an individual will \"split\" and create alter personalities as a response to adverse traumatic experiences.\nThough the word splitting is used in the context of both dissociative Identity disorder and borderline personality disorder and there is comorbidity between the two, the definition of splitting is not the same.\n\n\n## History\n\n\nSplitting of consciousness (\"normal self\" vs. \"secondary self\") was first described by Pierre Janet in De l'automatisme psychologique (1889). His ideas were extended by Eugen Bleuler (who in 1908 coined the word schizophrenia from the Ancient Greek skh\u00edz\u014d [\u03c3\u03c7\u03af\u03b6\u03c9, \"to split\"] and phr\u1e17n [\u03c6\u03c1\u03ae\u03bd, \"mind\"]) and Sigmund Freud to explain the splitting (German: Spaltung) of consciousness\u2014not (with Janet) as the product of innate weakness, but as the result of inner conflict. With the development of the idea of repression, splitting moved to the background of Freud's thought for some years, being largely reserved for cases of double personality. However, his late work saw a renewed interest in how it was \"possible for the ego to avoid a rupture... by effecting a cleavage or division of itself\", a theme which was extended in his Outline of Psycho-Analysis (1940a [1938]) beyond fetishism to the neurotic in general.\nHis daughter Anna Freud explored how, in healthy childhood development, a splitting of loving and aggressive instincts could be avoided.\nThere was, however, from early on, another use of the term \"splitting\" in Freud that referred rather to resolving ambivalence \"by splitting the contradictory feelings so that one person is only loved, another one only hated ... the good mother and the wicked stepmother in fairy tales\". Or, with opposing feelings of love and hate, perhaps \"the two opposites should have been split apart and one of them, usually the hatred, has been repressed\". Such splitting was closely linked to the defence of \"isolation ... The division of objects into congenial and uncongenial ones ... making 'disconnections'\".\n\nIt was the latter sense of the term that was predominantly adopted and exploited by Melanie Klein. After Freud, \"the most important contribution has come from Melanie Klein, whose work enlightens the idea of 'splitting of the object' (Objektspaltung) (in terms of 'good/bad' objects)\". In her object relations theory, Klein argues that \"the earliest experiences of the infant are split between wholly good ones with 'good' objects and wholly bad experiences with 'bad' objects\", as children struggle to integrate the two primary drives, love and hate, into constructive social interaction. An important step in childhood development is the gradual depolarization of these two drives.\nAt what Klein called the paranoid-schizoid position, there is a stark separation of the things the child loves (good, gratifying objects) and the things the child hates (bad, frustrating objects), \"because everything is polarised into extremes of love and hate, just like what the baby seems to experience and young children are still very close to\". Klein refers to the good breast and the bad breast as split mental entities, resulting from the way \"these primitive states tend to deconstruct objects into 'good' and 'bad' bits (called 'part-objects')\". The child sees the breasts as opposite in nature at different times, although they actually are the same, belonging to the same mother. As the child learns that people and objects can be good and bad at the same time, he or she progresses to the next phase, the depressive position, which \"entails a steady, though painful, approximation towards the reality of oneself and others\": integrating the splits and \"being able to balance [them] out ... are tasks that continue into early childhood and indeed are never completely finished\".\nHowever, Kleinians also use Freud's first conception of splitting to explain the way \"in a related process of splitting, the person divides his own self. This is called 'splitting of the ego'\". Indeed, Klein herself maintained that \"the ego is incapable of splitting the object\u2014internal or external\u2014without a corresponding splitting taking place within the ego\". Arguably at least, by this point \"the idea of splitting does not carry the same meaning for Freud and for Klein\": for the former, \"the ego finds itself 'passively' split, as it were. For Klein and the post-Kleinians, on the other hand, splitting is an 'active' defence mechanism\". As a result, by the close of the century \"four kinds of splitting can be clearly identified, among many other possibilities\" for post-Kleinians: \"a coherent split in the object, a coherent split in the ego, a fragmentation of the object, and a fragmentation of the ego\".\nIn the developmental model of Otto Kernberg, the overcoming of splitting is also an important developmental task. The child has to learn to integrate feelings of love and hate. Kernberg distinguishes three different stages in the development of a child with respect to splitting:\n\nThe child does not experience the self and the object, nor the good and the bad as different entities.\nGood and bad are viewed as different. Because the boundaries between the self and the other are not stable yet, the other as a person is viewed as either all good or all bad, depending on their actions. This also means that thinking about another person as bad implies that the self is bad as well, so it's better to think about the caregiver as a good person, so the self is viewed as good too: \"Bringing together extremely opposite loving and hateful images of the self and of significant others would trigger unbearable anxiety and guilt\".\nSplitting \u2013 \"the division of external objects into 'all good' or 'all bad'\" \u2013 begins to be resolved when the self and the other can be seen as possessing both good and bad qualities. Having hateful thoughts about the other does not mean that the self is all hateful and does not mean that the other person is all hateful either.\nIf a person fails to accomplish this developmental task satisfactorily, borderline pathology can emerge. In the borderline personality organization, Kernberg found \"dissociated ego states that result from the use of 'splitting' defences\". His therapeutic work then aimed at \"the analysis of the repeated and oscillating projections of unwanted self and object representations onto the therapist\" so as to produce \"something more durable, complex and encompassing than the initial, split-off and polarized state of affairs\".\n\n\n## Horizontal and vertical\n\nHeinz Kohut has emphasized in his self psychology the distinction between horizontal and vertical forms of splitting. Traditional psychoanalysis saw repression as forming a horizontal barrier between different levels of the mind \u2013 so that for example an unpleasant truth might be accepted superficially but denied in a deeper part of the psyche. Kohut contrasted this with vertical fractures of the mind into two parts with incompatible attitudes separated by mutual disavowal.\n\n\n## Transference\n\n\nIt has been suggested that interpretation of the transference \"becomes effective through a sort of splitting of the ego into a reasonable, judging portion and an experiencing portion, the former recognizing the latter as not appropriate in the present and as coming from the past\". Clearly, \"in this sense, splitting, so far from being a pathological phenomenon, is a manifestation of self-awareness\". Nevertheless, \"it remains to be investigated how this desirable 'splitting of the ego' and 'self-observation' are to be differentiated from the pathological cleavage ... directed at preserving isolations\".\nTransference is when someone who splits conveys feelings, attitudes, or defenses against someone currently in front of them, or who they are speaking to, who is not the actual object or target of those exact feelings. It is commonly expressed where a behavioral therapist purposefully draws out specific feelings or triggers to allow an individual to work through their emotions.\nBecause these individuals also have a split ego or consciousness, this can make them feel the emotions that are drawn out towards the person that is doing so even if that is not how they actually feel towards that person.\nTransference is not the goal, however, because it can hinder the relationship built between client and therapist due to the permanent or temporary feelings that an individual may feel towards another. This hindrance usually occurs when the individual does not grasp the concept of what he or she is struggling with. Though, if they do understand, the process can be positive because the individual can begin practicing ways to cope with the emotions, defenses, or fantasies they have created and projected onto others. This all depends on the relationship built with the therapist due to these hindrances and whether or not they can be worked through.\nThe inability to grasp insight in transference is called negative transference. This is where an individual projects these fantasies, emotions, or defense on their therapist or another individual and cannot work them out due to an inability to gain insight or truly understand their own struggles. This can create a negative therapist/client relationship and cause treatment to be both ineffective and harmful to the client. However, positive transference can also occur where the individual projects these same emotions but, because they have gained insight into their mental struggles, can work through these projections leading to a productive, effective, and helpful treatment.\n\n\n## See also\n\n",

      "text": "# Spontaneous_recovery\n\nSpontaneous recovery is a medical phenomenon of learning and memory. This phenomenon was first coined and described by Ivan Pavlov in his studies of classical (Pavlovian) conditioning. In that context, it refers to the re-emergence of a previously extinguished conditioned response after a delay. The recovery of such lost behaviors can be observed in a variety of contexts, and the recovery of forgotten human memories is often of particular interest.\n\n\n## In classical conditioning\n\n\nSpontaneous recovery is associated with classical conditioning, a learning process in which an organism learns to associate a neutral stimulus with a stimulus that produces an unconditioned response. As a result, the previously neutral stimulus comes to produce its own response, which is usually similar to that produced by the unconditioned stimulus. Although aspects of classical conditioning had been noted by previous scholars, the first experimental analysis of the process was conducted by Ivan Pavlov, a nineteenth-century physiologist who came across the associative effects of conditioning while researching canine digestion.\nTo study digestion, Pavlov presented various types of food to dogs and measured their salivary response. He noticed that with repeated testing, the dogs began to salivate before the food was presented, such as when they heard the footsteps of an approaching experimenter. Pavlov named this anticipatory behavior the \"conditioned\" response. He and his associates discovered and published the basic facts about this process, which has come to be known as classical or Pavlovian conditioning.\nAmong the phenomena that Pavlov observed was the partial recovery of a classically conditioned response after it had been extinguished by withholding the unconditioned stimulus. This recovery happened without any further unconditioned stimulation, and Pavlov referred to it as spontaneous recovery. Although the chance of spontaneous recovery increases with time following the extinction procedure, such conditioned responses generally do not return to full strength. Moreover, with repeated recovery/extinction cycles, the conditioned response tends to be less intense with each period of recovery. However, reconditioning by pairing the same conditioned and unconditioned stimuli usually occurs much faster than the original conditioning.\nA key conclusion is that conditioning leaves a lasting trace in the organism's memory, and that extinction does not erase the original conditioning but merely suppresses it. This insight has had profound implications for theories of classical conditioning and practical applications, particularly in behavioral therapy.\n\n\n## In human memory\n\n\n\n### Retroactive interference\nSpontaneous recovery as it pertains to human memory can be traced back to the work of George Edward Briggs, who was concerned with the concept of retroactive interference. Inhibition, or interference, is a function of competition among responses, whereby one memory has dominance over another. The inhibited responses are not lost from memory per se, but are kept from appearing by other responses.\nRetroactive interference is the psychological theory of memory whereby learning something new impedes retrieval of a previously learned memory. Briggs studied retroactive interference using a test of free recall. In his study, participants learned paired associate words (i.e. A1-B1, A2-B2,...Ai-Bi) over multiple trials, until the learning of the Ai-Bi associates was perfected. Following this, participants were given a new list of paired associates, where the second word of the pair was changed while the first word of the associate pair was kept the same (A1-C1, A2-C2,... Ai-Ci). After mastery of this second list, Briggs had participants perform a recall procedure. He presented a list A item and asked the participant to recall whichever pair (the -Bi or \u2013Ci) that came to mind. Based on retroactive interference, learning of A-B paired associates declined due to the learning of the subsequent A-C associates, and as a result, there was a higher rate of responses from list C by the participants on the recall test.\nOne day (24 hours) after learning both sets of associates, participants were tested again. A spontaneous recovery of Bi responses was observed, such that participants' responses of Bi items exceeded Ci items. After a rest period, participants could spontaneously remember the initial paired associates that they were not able to remember following the subsequent presentation of a second paired associate list the day prior. This A-B, A-C paradigm was replicated by researcher Bruce R. Ekstrand, thus increasing confirmation regarding the existence of spontaneous recovery.\n\n\n### Role of sleep\nIn an experiment conducted to further the findings of Briggs and Ekstrand, it was discovered that sleep counteracts retroactive interference compared to wakefulness. Using the same A-B, A-C paradigm, results indicated that memory performance for the first list of word-pair associates (A-B) was superior when learning was followed by nocturnal sleep rather than wakefulness. Sleep differentially affected the memory consolidation of the two lists, enhancing the memory for the first list more significantly. It has been suggested that the degree of initial learning predicts whether spontaneous recovery shall occur, stating that the better the learning of the A-B associations, the more likely they are to recover after interference. This effect is further catalyzed by sleep, which appears to have an enhancing effect on memory consolidation.\n\n\n### Traumatic memories\nEmotionally unpleasant experiences tend to recur, even after frequent suppression. Such memories can be recovered gradually, through active search and reconstruction, or they can come to mind spontaneously, without active search.\nIt is suggested that there are important differences between people who gradually recover memories of abuse during suggestive therapy sessions and those who recover memories of abuse more spontaneously. Research on the propensity to forget what they had just remembered was conducted on women who had spontaneously recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse, versus those who recovered them through suggestive therapy. Women who spontaneously recovered their abuse were more likely (than women who recovered their memories of childhood abuse during suggestive therapy) to forget that they had successfully remembered words earlier on a memory test. As such, a reason that people might have a spontaneously recovered traumatic memory experience is because they simply forget having remembered the event before. They might forget prior cases of remembering if the mental context present when they are having their recovery experience differs from the mental context on prior occasions when they thought about the event. Thus, people have not forgotten the event, but they simply cannot remember it, perhaps due to context-dependent memory.\n\n\n## Context-dependent extinction phenomena\n\n\n\n### Renewal effect\nThe renewal effect is a phenomenon in which a change of context after extinction can cause a robust return of conditioned responding. There are three models in which the renewal effect is observed.\n\nThe most common model is the \"ABA renewal\". Conditioning is conducted in one context (context A) and extinction is then conducted in a second (context B). When the conditional stimulus (CS) is returned to the original conditioning context (context A), responding to the CS returns.\nA second version, \"ABC renewal\" is where conditioning is conducted in context A, extinction is conducted in context B, and then testing is conducted in a third, \"neutral\" context (context C). Renewal of responding is observed in the neutral context.\nThe final version, \"AAB renewal\" ,works whereby conditioning and extinction are both conducted in the same context (context A) and then the CS is tested in a second context (context B). This model currently has the least evidence of returned conditioned responding.\nSince spontaneous recovery is defined as an extinguished response occurring after time has passed following the extinction, it can be viewed as the renewal effect that results when the CS is tested outside of its temporal context.\n\n\n=### Role of GABA in renewal effects=\nGamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission plays a significant role in the processes of renewal and spontaneous recovery from extinction. In a study that tested the spontaneous recovery of appetitive responding of rats, normal control rats responded more to a CS when it was tested in its acquisition context (this is ABA renewal) than its extinction context (ABB renewal condition). This is a classic example of ABA renewal. Administration of the partial inverse agonist, FG-7142, to the GABAA receptor resulted in attenuated recovery in both the ABA and ABB test scenarios. The GABAA receptor inverse agonist reduced GABA transmission, and the result was attenuation of the impact of context in eliciting the renewal effect. This research suggests that GABAergic mechanisms (mechanisms pertaining to neurons that produce GABA as their output) mediate ABA renewal and spontaneous recovery in appetitive conditioning. As such, spontaneous recovery and renewal are believed to share a common psychological mechanism.\n\n\n### Rapid reacquisition\nReacquisition of a conditioned response (CR) post-extinction is often faster than the initial acquisition. This indicates that the original learning was not destroyed but rather was \"saved\" through the process of extinction. Rapid reacquisition is normally produced when reinforced trials provide a contextual cue that can renew responding by signaling the initial acquisition trials.\nData from studies conducted on conditioned suppression provide evidence that this effect might occur due to spontaneous recovery and reinstatement of contextual stimuli that did not get extinguished, and thus remain related to the US.\nRapid reacquisition may be partially an effect of ABA renewal, whereby an animal (undergoing conditional learning) learns that the initial conditioning trials with the CS-US pairings are part of an original context of conditioning, whereas the more recent presentations of the CS alone are part of the context of extinction. Thus, when CS-US pairings are resumed post-extinction, they put the animal back into the mindset of the original conditioning context, and this contextual cue aids in reacquiring the CR more quickly than the initial learning. As such, rapid reacquisition will be produced when reinforced initial learning trials create a contextual cue, that in future acquisition trials gets activated and brings about the renewal of responding at a quicker rate than the initial response learning.\nThe process of extinction involves trials that are not reinforced, so that the CR of the animal declines when presented with the CS. A situation in which extinction procedures contain both reinforced and non-reinforced trials would weaken reacquisition, because introducing reinforced trials during extinction would result in the reinforced trials being associated both with extinction and conditional learning. This would render the animal less able to rapidly learn again the CR to the stimulus.\n\n\n### Reinstatement\nReinstatement refers to the recovery of conditioned behavior produced by exposures to the US. Reinstatement occurs when one is re-exposed to the US alone, after having undergone extinction. The effect is due to conditioning of the context, such that when the US is presented after extinction, an individual associates it with the original context.\nConsider an example regarding reinstatement: say you learned an aversion to mangos because you got sick after eating one on a trip. Extinction of the aversion would result if you frequently ate bits of mangos without getting sick. Reinstatement suggests that if you became sick again for some reason, the aversion to mangos would return even if your illness had nothing to do with eating mangos. In this example, after extinction, presentation of the US (the experience of being sick) brings about the conditioned behaviour to be aversive to mangos.\n\n\n### Retrieval cues\nThe time at which a cue is presented has an important effect on whether it will be an efficient cue in either attenuating or enhancing recovery. If a cue is featured in extinction, it will attenuate spontaneous recovery more so than an equally familiar control cue that was featured in conditioning. This is because spontaneous recovery depends on the cue's specific correlation with extinction, and reintroducing a stimulus that is correlated with extinction will reduce spontaneous recovery of the response in future attempts at its retrieval.\nProposed views on extinction cues suggest that they reduce the degree to which the test condition matches conditioning. It is not that the extinction cue necessarily disrupts response performance via inhibition, but rather, the extinction cue functions to retrieve a memory of extinction. Such an extinction memory is that in which the CS and US are not related, and as such, spontaneous recovery of the response prior to extinction is attenuated. Spontaneous recovery would successfully occur if the subject failed to retrieve an extinction memory upon being presented with the extinction cue; however, it is usually observed that presenting an extinction cue leads to attenuated spontaneous recovery.\n\n\n## Pathways of recall\n\nMemories can be very different in nature, and as a result, different memories are stored and subsequently recalled via appropriate neural circuitry in the brain. The pathways of recalling a memory will therefore depend on the nature of the remembered stimuli that is being retrieved. Memory representation of different types of information can take on various forms.\n\n\n### Language recall\nRegarding language processing in the human brain there is: 1) the existence of left hemisphere temporoparietal language areas outside the Wernicke's area; 2) extensive left prefrontal language areas outside the Broca's area; and 3) participation of these left frontal areas in a task emphasizing receptive language functions. A 1985 study conducted by Lendrem and Lincoln examines the spontaneous recovery of language abilities in 52 stroke patients between 4 and 34 weeks after the stroke. These patients had been suffering from aphasia, a disorder impairing the comprehension and expression of language, for more than 4 weeks. Patients had been randomly allocated to receive no speech therapy and had been assessed at 6 weekly intervals after the stroke incident, over which time there was a gradual improvement in language abilities. There was a lack of difference between factors such as sex, age, or aphasia type, suggesting that the amount of improvement expected in any patient cannot be readily predicted. Most recovery occurred in the first 3 months after stroke, and the level of the language abilities at 6 months post-stroke seem to depend almost exclusively on the severity of the patient's aphasia. A second study conducted in London, Ontario, took a closer look at oral imitation. Recovery on oral imitation was less than for comprehension tasks when tested for in the study. They suspected this result was attributable to the difference between spontaneous recovery and the recovery aided by speech therapy. Oral imitation would be practiced language behaviour whereas performance on language comprehension is a result of the spontaneous recovery of language processing abilities.\n\n\n### Audio recall\nThe pathway of recall associated with the retrieval of sound memories is the auditory system. Within the auditory system is the auditory cortex, which can be broken down into the primary auditory cortex and the belt areas. The primary auditory cortex is the main region of the brain that processes sound and is located on the superior temporal gyrus in the temporal lobe where it receives point-to-point input from the medial geniculate nucleus. From this, the primary auditory complex had a topographic map of the cochlea. The belt areas of the auditory complex receive more diffuse input from peripheral areas of the medial geniculate nucleus and therefore are less precise in tonotopic organization compared to the primary visual cortex. A 2001 study by Trama examined how different kinds of brain damage interfere with normal perception of music. One of his studied patients lost most of his auditory cortex to strokes, allowing him to still hear but making it difficult to understand music since he could not recognize harmonic patterns. Detecting a similarity between speech perception and sound perception, spontaneous recovery of lost auditory information is possible in those patients who have experienced a stroke or other major head trauma. Amusia is a disorder manifesting itself as a defect in processing pitch but also affects one's memory and recognition for music.\nA study by Sarkamo and colleagues examined the neural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie acquired amusia and contribute to its recovery. They assessed 53 stroke patients three times within 6 months of having a stroke. This longitudinal setting of the study was used to determine the relationship between the recovery of music perception and the recovery of other cognitive functions. Results showed that amusia recovery was associated with a wide range of other functions such as language and visuospatial cognition. Stroke patients showed a recovery of implicit memory for musical structures and could produce tone intervals they were unable to perceive when tested originally. This suggests that although spontaneous recovery is possible with auditory cognition similar to other forms of cognitive function, there may be the possibility of an action-perception mismatch.\n\n\n### Visual recall\nThe pathway of recall associated with the retrieval of visual memories is the visual system. The image is captured by the eye and then transmitted to the brain by the optic nerve, which terminates on the cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus. The main target that the lateral geniculate nucleus projects onto is the primary visual cortex, which is the part of the cerebral cortex responsible for processing visual information. The analysis of visual stimuli continues through two major cortical systems for processing. The first is the ventral pathway, which extends to the temporal lobe and is involved in recognizing objects (the \"what\" pathway). The second is the dorsal pathway, which projects to the parietal lobe and is essential in locating objects (the \"where\" pathway).\nIn one study in 1995, Mark Wheeler illustrated spontaneous recovery of visual stimuli by presenting students with twelve pictures and allowing them three opportunities to study the pictures. The students were told this list was only for practice and then were shown two additional \"real\" lists for which they had to do the same thing. The students were given a free recall test after the third list for the pictures studied on the first list. Recall suffers significantly at first due to retroactive interference by the two additional lists. However, after thirty minutes free recall of the first-list pictures actually gets better. Perhaps these forgotten items recover because inhibition is gradually decreased.\n\n\n## Depth of processing\n\nCraik and Lockhart proposed a framework for the various levels of processing a stimulus. They assumed that the level or depth of processing of a stimulus has a large effect on its memorability. Deeper analysis produces more elaborate, longer-lasting and stronger memory traces. The stronger memories are, the more likely they will be to exhibit recovery.\n\n\n### Reminiscence\nReminiscence is the remembering again of the forgotten without re-learning, a gradual process of improvement in the capacity to revive past experiences. Simply put, it is the act of remembering information on a later test that could not be remembered on an earlier test. Ballard coined the term reminiscence in 1913 when he conducted a study asking young school children to memorize poetry. He found that over successive recalls, the children would often recall new lines of poetry that they failed to recall previously. The concept of reminiscence can be applied in treatment settings for patients with memory impairment. Reminiscence therapy involves the discussion of past activities and experiences with another person, utilizing tangible aids such as photographs to cue recall. This is normally used to assist dementia patients suffering from extreme memory loss. Reminiscence is also associated with one's own autobiographical memory, which is not evenly distributed through the lifespan. When left to recall their own self-memories, people over the age of forty experience a reminiscence bump, having a marked increase of memories from the period between ages fifteen and thirty. Reminiscence is required for the phenomenon of hypermnesia (an overall improvement in performance across tests) but hypermnesia is not required for reminiscence.\n\n\n### Hypermnesia\nHypermnesia is an improvement in memory that occurs with related attempts to retrieve previously encoded material. Hypermnesia is the net result of reminiscence and forgetting, such that the amount of reminiscence must exceed the amount of forgetting resulting in a net improvement overall. Ballard was the first to observe hypermnesia using a multiple recall task in 1913, the same task with which he discovered reminiscence. After asking young school children to memorize poetry, he initially retested their recall abilities 2 days later only to discover that the class improved by 10% over the initial recall level.\nHypermnesia was not considered a phenomenon until the mid-1970s, when Erdelyi and his associates completed further testing. Two suggestions have been offered to explain the increases in net recall over testing. One suggestion is that pictures and high imagery words enhance hypermnesia, speculating that this nature of stimuli is more recognizable and hence less susceptible to forgetting. The second suggestion is Roediger's level of recall hypothesis claiming that any variable that produces greater levels of depth processing lead to greater hypermnesia.\nA 1991 study by Otani and Hodge suggests that hypermnesia does not occur with recognition but is found in cued recall experiments, showing that the improvement in memory performance is due to an increased rate of item recovery facilitated by relational processing. Relational processing can be made easier with well-categorized stimuli and helps to increase the availability or retrieval cues that in turn help to generate the to-be-remembered items. The phenomenon of hypermnesia continues to be examined, particularly in terms of its generalization.\n\n\n## Therapies\n\n\n\n### Hypnotherapy\nThe term \"hypnosis\" is derived from the Greek word hypnos, which means \"sleep\". When in a state of hypnosis, otherwise known as a trance, one experiences deep relaxation and altered consciousness. This trance is particularly characterized by extreme suggestibility and heightened imagination. Within this state, individuals have complete free will and are fully conscious, however they become hyperattentive to the subject at hand and nearly exclude any other thought.\nThis state of trance is widely used as a means to recall suppressed or repressed memories. During hypnosis sessions, a great deal of spontaneous recovery can occur because the conscious thoughts are slowed down to allow much higher retrieval. Some memories can seem foreign to the patient because they have never been recalled before; this is usual proof that the therapy is working.\n\n\n=### False memories=\nAlthough hypnosis and other suggestive therapy is a great way to create spontaneous recovery of memories, false memories can be constructed in the process. False memories are memories that contain facts that are incorrect, yet they are strongly believed by the person obtaining the memory. Research states that a lot of suggestive therapy can cause a false memory in patients because of the intense suggestions given by the trusted therapist. Suggestions can stir up memories from movies, stories, magazines, and many other of the innumerable stimuli one sees throughout their life. Hypnosis is a more relaxed, aware state where subjects can bypass a lot of the conscious doubts and mind chatter and be aware of what comes up from the unconscious.\nIn the United States many mental health workers rely on hypnosis to retrieve memories. Previous research concludes that with the active conscious mind consistently occupying one's mental capacity, hypnosis provides the calmness to retrieve what's needed.\n\n\n### Psychoanalytic therapy\nPsychoanalytic therapy is a form of therapy where the patient discusses their life issues with a therapist, who asks specific questions while using their expertise to find underlying issues. This method of therapy can cause spontaneous recovery that is cued from the therapists questioning. Psychoanalytic therapy has been known to treat many behavioural problems, unconscious feelings and thoughts that affect the present moment. Through recalling specific events and gaining a new perspective, a patient can alleviate the issue they are concerned with.\n\n\n### Group therapy\nGroup therapy is similar to psychoanalytic therapy but it involves other people with a similar issue. This therapy adds other perspectives to gain clarity on a situation, and can cause spontaneous recovery in more cases because of the increase in other points of view.\n\n\n### Cognitive behavioural therapy\nCognitive behavioural therapy is a therapy that works with irrational thinking towards a specific situation. The key here is that the person may have not had that specific behavioural problem their whole life, and allowing them to view the event with a new perspective can change their behaviour. This is done differently from psychoanalytic therapy by exposing the patient to the stimulus they are afraid of. Through this exposure, they can unlearn any patterns of thought they had towards it by realizing that they are safe, referred to as extinction. Although, studies have shown that certain stimuli can cue a spontaneous recovery if there was not a full extinction of the associated perception to a memory.\n\n\n### Cases\nOne case documented by researcher Geraerts portrays both spontaneous recovery and false memories in the case of Elizabeth Janssen (name has been changed for the patient's courtesy). She was a very depressed woman and she had no idea why. Her life was great and up to her standards but she felt an underlying depressed feeling. She went to suggestive therapy where the therapist decided to engage her in visual imagery techniques to attempt to bring up childhood abuse that the therapist suggested she had. She denied ever being abused and had no recollection at all of such events. The therapist gave her books to read and information to study on childhood abuse. As the weeks went on with therapy she began recalling images of her father sexually abusing her. Within this case one can speculate that the therapist could have implanted these memories with weeks of suggestion, self-study, and authoritative persuasion that took place.\n\n\n## Physiology\n\n\n\n### Procedural memory\nFor spontaneous recovery to occur, the conditioning of the memory that is recalled later needs to be stored in long-term memory. It is a process where the semantics and associations of the certain memory are so ingrained that they can become habitual or automatic to the person. For example, all the procedures needed to ride a bicycle are not taken into play every time you ride it. One simply knows to step on the pedal, propel their body up onto the seat, grip the handles, begin to pedal, look ahead, check the gears, balance oneself, etc. All of this becomes a form of implicit memory that doesn't need any attention to control or effort in recall; they are there for use in any particular circumstance.\nWith regard to a more general application of procedural learning in our life is with our beliefs and values we can hold to a certain subject. For example, if many times you get extremely jealous of someone having something that you do not have because your family can't afford it when you were young, you could believe that \"things in life are hard to come by\". When you're an adult another situation could arise that is similar, and the recovery of that association and inner response can show up spontaneously as jealousy again. It is why a lot of people say to themselves, \"where does this feeling come from\" or, \"Why did I do that?\" A lot of human reactions are from spontaneous recovery of past associations, not always specifically learned physical behaviours.\n\n\n### Neurochemistry\nFor the learning and recall associated with spontaneous recovery to happen, there are specific gyri and neurotransmitters that play a role. Firstly, the cerebellum is needed to acquire certain motor skills and develop an automatic state with the movement patterns that are learned. Both the dorsal and ventral prefrontal cortex have been shown to play a big role in the development of memory consolidation and motor control. Reciprocal loops are formed through neural circuits between the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex which consolidate the memory. To elicit a stronger consolidation, rewards can be involved; the case for Pavlovian conditioning. The reward-related learning causes dopamine to release from the synapses of the basal ganglia and creates a stronger bond between the stimulus and response. Furthermore, if there is a traumatic incident that is associated to a memory, and that becomes suppressed, the amygdala is responsible for this fear conditioning. The amygdala leads to the caudate nucleus in the neocortex of the basal ganglia, so the fear response can also be triggered via spontaneous recovery. Basically, the stronger the emotional arousal after a learning event, positive or negative, can greatly enhance the memory's recall in the future.\nAnother area of the brain important for memory recovery is the hippocampus and medial temporal lobes. Regarding the former, studies have shown that the hippocampus is a crucial area to strengthen memories by forming stronger connections between neurons. This is done when a person associates more stimuli with a particular memory and it becomes more easily accessible. Temporal lobes are said to be the area of the brain that are important for storing new memories when learning. The availability of memories accessible to recall is positively correlated with the size and function of a person's temporal lobe.\n\n\n## Drugs and psychostimulants\n\nAll drugs and stimulants of the brain can affect how someone learns, consolidates, and retrieves certain memories. For example, cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain, causing an increase of dopamine in the synaptic cleft. This will elicit a rewarding feeling of liberation and security that can become addictive to some people. However, because of the increased dopamine levels in the brain, consolidation of memory can be affected which will then inhibit the chances of recovering that memory. Studies show that rats who were given cocaine were unable to perform motor tasks as successfully as the control group. Cannabis can also negatively affect spontaneous memory recovery because the plasticity strength of the initial memories are so inhibited due to the reduced neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft.\nAnother relation of drugs to spontaneous recovery is the incidents regarding relapse. A recovered addict can be presented with stimuli that spontaneously recover motivational feelings that are believed to cause the relapse. The longer the extinction period of the abstinence from the drug, the more vulnerable the person is to relapsing spontaneously. For example, cocaine addicts who are thought to be \"cured\" can experience an irresistible impulse to use the drug again if they are subsequently confronted by a stimulus with strong connections to the drug, such as a white powder.\n\n\n## Disorders\n\nSpontaneous recovery, in terms of disorders, is a phenomenon in which the unwanted condition is overcome without professional treatment or formal help.\n\n\n### Autism\nA case study reported that an individual spontaneously \"recovered\" from autistic disorder after a mere 13 days without therapeutic intervention. This individual was diagnosed with autistic disorder and severe mental retardation as per the DSM-IV-TR criteria. Over the course of 13 days, this individual revealed age appropriate reciprocal social interaction and communication by means of gesture, when no signs of communication were visible prior to the onset of the recovery period. This individual could also now show affection, emotional warmth, and self-expression.\nNo other instances of such rapid spontaneous \"recovery\" from autism have been yet documented, and currently, this \"recovery\" is quite unexplained and a matter of controversy.\n\n\n### Aphasia\nSpontaneous recovery of language ability has been documented in patients who became aphasic following a stroke. For the purposes of assessing spontaneous recovery, the patients received no speech therapy and were assessed weekly following the stroke. Improvement in language ability occurred, despite the lack of professional treatment. Improvement occurred most markedly between the 4 and 10 weeks after the stroke, with little change following this time period. Most studies of spontaneous language recovery following stroke have exhibited that the improvement occurs within the first 3 to 4 months. This finding is of particular interest to speech therapists, to be able to separate natural recovery from aphasia in stroke patients, from improvement that is intervention-based.\n\n\n## Further reading\n\n",

      "text": "# Stimulus\u2013response_model\n\nThe stimulus\u2013response model is a conceptual framework in psychology that describes how individuals react to external stimuli. According to this model, an external stimulus triggers a reaction in an organism, often without the need for conscious thought. This model emphasizes the mechanistic aspects of behavior, suggesting that behavior can often be predicted and controlled by understanding and manipulating the stimuli that trigger responses.\n\n\n## Fields of application\n\nStimulus\u2013response models are applied in international relations, \npsychology, \nrisk assessment, \nneuroscience,\nneurally-inspired system design,\nand many other fields.\nPharmacological dose response relationships are an application of stimulus-response models.\nAnother field this model can be applied to is psychological problems/disorders such as Tourette syndrome. Research shows Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) can be characterized by enhanced cognitive functions related to creating, modifying and maintaining connections between stimuli and responses (S\u2010R links). Specifically, two areas, procedural sequence learning and, as a novel finding, also event file binding, show converging evidence of hyperfunctioning in GTS.\nPrevious research on E-learning has proven that studying online can be even more daunting for lecturers and students who suddenly change their learning patterns from the classrooms to the virtual ones. This is mainly because the suddenness of this change makes it difficult for lecturers to fully prepare to lecture in the virtual learning environment. In light of the above-mentioned facts, this research proposes a novel model and integrates flow theory into the theory of technology acceptance model (TAM), based on stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) theory, the SOR model has been widely used in previous studies of online customer behavior, and the model theory includes three components: stimulus, organism, and response. Assuming that stimuli contained in the external environment cause people to change, which affects their behavior.\n\n\n## Mathematical formulation\n\nThe object of a stimulus\u2013response model is to establish a mathematical function that describes the relation f between the stimulus x and the expected value (or other measure of location) of the response Y:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n        \n        (\n        Y\n        )\n        =\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {E} (Y)=f(x)}\n  \n\nA common simplification assumed for such functions is linear, thus we expect to see a relationship like\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n        \n        (\n        Y\n        )\n        =\n        \u03b1\n        +\n        \u03b2\n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {E} (Y)=\\alpha +\\beta x.}\n  \n\nStatistical theory for linear models has been well developed for more than fifty years, and a standard form of analysis called linear regression has been developed.\n\n\n## Bounded response functions\n\nSince many types of response have inherent physical limitations (e.g. minimal maximal muscle contraction), it is often applicable to use a bounded function (such as the logistic function) to model the response. Similarly, a linear response function may be unrealistic as it would imply arbitrarily large responses. For binary dependent variables, statistical analysis with regression methods such as the probit model or logit model, or other methods such as the Spearman\u2013K\u00e4rber method.

Pavlov popularized and revolutionized the theory though by experimenting on the dogs.\n\n\n## References\n\n\n\n## Further reading\n\n",

      "text": "# Subconscious\n\nIn psychology, the subconscious is the part of the mind that is not currently of focal awareness. The term was already popularized in the early 20th century in areas ranging from psychology, religion and spirituality. The concept was heavily popularized by Joseph Murphy's 1963 self-help book The Power of Your Subconscious Mind.\n\n\n## Scholarly use of the term\n\nThe word subconscious represents an anglicized version of the French subconscient as coined by\nJohn Norris, in \"An Essay Towards the Theory of the Ideal or Intelligible World\u201d (1708):\n\"The immediate objects of Sense, are not the objects of Intellection, they being of a Subconscient [subconscious] nature.\" A more recent use was in 1889 by the psychologist Pierre Janet (1859\u20131947), in his doctorate of letters thesis, Of Psychological Automatism (French: De l'Automatisme Psychologique. Janet argued that underneath the layers of critical-thought functions of the conscious mind lay a powerful awareness that he called the subconscious mind.\nIn the strict psychological sense, the adjective is defined as \"operating or existing outside of consciousness\".\nLocke and Kristof write that there is a limit to what can be held in conscious focal awareness, an alternative storehouse of one's knowledge and prior experience is needed, which they label the subconscious.\n\n\n## Psychoanalysis\n\nSigmund Freud used the term \"subconscious\" in 1893 to describe associations and impulses that are not accessible to consciousness. He later abandoned the term in favor of unconscious, noting the following: If someone talks of subconsciousness, I cannot tell whether he means the term topographically \u2013 to indicate something lying in the mind beneath consciousness \u2013 or qualitatively \u2013 to indicate another consciousness, a subterranean one, as it were. He is probably not clear about any of it. The only trustworthy antithesis is between conscious and unconscious.\nIn 1896, in Letter 52, Freud introduced the stratification of mental processes, noting that memory-traces are occasionally re-arranged in accordance with new circumstances. In this theory, he differentiated between Wahrnehmungszeichen (\"Indication of perception\"), Unbewusstsein (\"the unconscious\") and Vorbewusstsein (\"the preconscious\"). From this point forward, Freud no longer used the term \"subconscious\" because, in his opinion, it failed to differentiate whether content and the processing occurred in the unconscious or preconscious mind.\nCharles Rycroft explains that the subconscious is a term \"never used in psychoanalytic writings\". Peter Gay says that the use of the term subconscious where unconscious is meant is \"a common and telling mistake\"; indeed, \"when [the term] is employed to say something 'Freudian', it is proof that the writer has not read [their] Freud\".\n\n\n## Analytical psychology\n\nCarl Jung said that since there is a limit to what can be held in conscious focal awareness, an alternative storehouse of one's knowledge and prior experience is needed.\n\n\n## \"New Age\" and other modalities targeting the subconscious\n\n\nThe idea of the subconscious as a powerful or potent agency has allowed the term to become prominent in New Age and self-help literature, in which investigating or controlling its supposed knowledge or power is seen as advantageous. In the New Age community, techniques such as autosuggestion and affirmations are believed to harness the power of the subconscious to influence a person's life and real-world outcomes, even curing sickness. Skeptical Inquirer magazine criticized the lack of falsifiability and testability of these claims. Physicist Ali Alousi, for instance, criticized it as unmeasurable and questioned the likelihood that thoughts can affect anything outside the head. In addition, critics have asserted that the evidence provided is usually anecdotal and that, because of the self-selecting nature of the positive reports, as well as the subjective nature of any results, these reports are susceptible to confirmation bias and selection bias.\nPsychologists and psychiatrists use the term \"unconscious\" in traditional practices, where metaphysical and New Age literature often use the term \"subconscious\". It should not, however, be inferred that the concept of the unconscious and the New Age concept of the subconscious are precisely equivalent, even though they both warrant consideration of mental processes of the brain. Psychologists and psychiatrists take a much more limited view of the capabilities of the unconscious than are represented by New Age depiction of the subconscious. There are a number of methods in use in the contemporary New Age and paranormal communities that affect the latter: affirmations, autosuggestion, binaural beats, hypnosis, and subliminal messages.\n\n\n## See also\n\n\nConsciousness\nCollective unconscious\nHistory of hypnosis\nNon-rapid eye movement sleep\nPreconscious\nRapid eye movement sleep\nSlow-wave sleep\nSubliminal stimuli\nUnconscious mind\nTransdisciplinary topics\nList of thought processes\nPhilosophy of mind\n\n\n## Notes and references\n\n\n\n## Further reading\n\nJacques Hadamard.

      "text": "# Substantia_nigra\n\nThe substantia nigra (SN) is a basal ganglia structure located in the midbrain that plays an important role in reward and movement. Substantia nigra is Latin for \"black substance\", reflecting the fact that parts of the substantia nigra appear darker than neighboring areas due to high levels of neuromelanin in dopaminergic neurons. Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the  substantia nigra pars compacta.\nAlthough the substantia nigra appears as a continuous band in brain sections, anatomical studies have found that it actually consists of two parts with very different connections and functions: the pars compacta (SNpc) and the pars reticulata (SNpr). The pars compacta serves mainly as a projection to the basal ganglia circuit, supplying the striatum with dopamine. The pars reticulata conveys signals from the basal ganglia to numerous other brain structures.\n\n\n## Structure\n\n\nThe substantia nigra, along with four other nuclei, is part of the basal ganglia. It is the largest nucleus in the midbrain, lying dorsal to the cerebral peduncles. Humans have two substantiae nigrae, one on each side of the midline.\nThe SN is divided into two parts: the pars reticulata (SNpr) and the pars compacta (SNpc), which lies medial to the pars reticulata. Sometimes, a third region, the pars lateralis, is mentioned, though it is usually classified as part of the pars reticulata. The (SNpr) and the internal globus pallidus (GPi) are separated by the internal capsule.\n\n\n### Pars reticulata\n\nThe pars reticulata bears a strong structural and functional resemblance to the internal part of the globus pallidus. The two are sometimes considered parts of the same structure, separated by the white matter of the internal capsule. Like those of the globus pallidus, the neurons in pars reticulata are mainly GABAergic.\n\n\n=### Afferent connections=\nThe main input to the SNpr derives from the striatum. It comes by two routes, known as the direct and indirect pathways. The direct pathway consists of axons from medium spiny cells in the striatum that project directly to pars reticulata. The indirect pathway consists of three links: a projection from striatal medium spiny cells to the external part of the globus pallidus; a GABAergic projection from the globus pallidus to the subthalamic nucleus, and a glutamatergic projection from the subthalamic nucleus to the pars reticulata. Thus, striatal activity via the direct pathway exerts an inhibitory effect on neurons in the (SNpr) but an excitatory effect via the indirect pathway. The direct and indirect pathways originate from different subsets of striatal medium spiny cells: They are tightly intermingled, but express different types of dopamine receptors, as well as showing other neurochemical differences.\n\n\n=### Efferent connections=\nSignificant projections occur to the thalamus (ventral lateral and ventral anterior nuclei), superior colliculus, and other caudal nuclei from the pars reticulata (the nigrothalamic pathway), which use GABA as their neurotransmitter. In addition, these neurons form up to five collaterals that branch within both the pars compacta and pars reticulata, likely modulating dopaminergic activity in the pars compacta.\n\n\n## Function\n\nThe substantia nigra is an important player in brain function, in particular, in eye movement, motor planning, reward-seeking, learning, and addiction. Many of the substantia nigra's effects are mediated through the striatum. The nigral dopaminergic input to the striatum via the nigrostriatal pathway is intimately linked with the striatum's function. The co-dependence between the striatum and substantia nigra can be seen in this way: when the substantia nigra is electrically stimulated, no movement occurs; however, the symptoms of nigral degeneration due to Parkinson's is a poignant example of the substantia nigra's influence on movement. In addition to striatum-mediated functions, the substantia nigra also serves as a major source of GABAergic inhibition to various brain targets.\n\n\n### Pars reticulata\n\nThe pars reticulata of the substantia nigra is an important processing center in the basal ganglia. The GABAergic neurons in the pars reticulata convey the final processed signals of the basal ganglia to the thalamus and superior colliculus. In addition, the pars reticulata also inhibits dopaminergic activity in the pars compacta via axon collaterals, although the functional organization of these connections remains unclear.\nThe GABAergic neurons of the pars reticulata spontaneously fire action potentials. In rats, the frequency of action potentials is roughly 25 Hz. The purpose of these spontaneous action potentials is to inhibit targets of the basal ganglia, and decreases in inhibition are associated with movement. The subthalamic nucleus gives excitatory input that modulates the rate of firing of these spontaneous action potentials. However, lesion of the subthalamic nucleus leads to only a 20% decrease in pars reticulata firing rate, suggesting that the generation of action potentials in the pars reticulata is largely autonomous, as exemplified by the pars reticulata's role in saccadic eye movement. A group of GABAergic neurons from the pars reticulata projects to the superior colliculus, exhibiting a high level of sustained inhibitory activity. Projections from the caudate nucleus to the superior colliculus also modulate saccadic eye movement.\nAltered patterns of pars reticulata firing such as single-spike or burst firing are found in Parkinson's disease and epilepsy.\n\n\n### Pars compacta\n\nThe most prominent function of the pars compacta is motor control, though the substantia nigra's role in motor control is indirect; electrical stimulation of the substantia nigra does not result in movement, due to mediation of the striatum in the nigral influence of movement. The pars compacta sends excitatory input to the striatum via D1 pathway that excites and activates the striatum, resulting in the release of GABA onto the globus pallidus to inhibit its inhibitory effects on the thalamic nucleus. This causes the thalamocortical pathways to become excited and transmits motor neuron signals to the cerebral cortex to allow the initiation of movement, which is absent in Parkinson's disease. However, lack of pars compacta neurons has a large influence on movement, as evidenced by the symptoms of Parkinson's. The motor role of the pars compacta may involve fine motor control, as has been confirmed in animal models with lesions in that region.\nThe pars compacta is heavily involved in learned responses to stimuli. In primates, dopaminergic neuron activity increases in the nigrostriatal pathway when a new stimulus is presented. Dopaminergic activity decreases with repeated stimulus presentation. However, behaviorally significant stimulus presentation (i.e. rewards) continues to activate dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta.  Dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area  (bottom part of the \"midbrain\" or mesencephalon) to the prefrontal cortex (mesocortical pathway) and to the nucleus accumbens (mesolimbic pathway \u2013 \"meso\" referring to \"from the mesencephalon\"... specifically the ventral tegmental area) are implicated in reward, pleasure, and addictive behavior.  The pars compacta is also important in spatial learning, the observations about one's environment and location in space. Lesions in the pars compacta lead to learning deficits in repeating identical movements, and some studies point to its involvement in a dorsal striatal-dependent, response-based memory system that functions relatively independent of the hippocampus, which is traditionally believed to subserve spatial or episodic-like memory functions.\nThe pars compacta also plays a role in temporal processing and is activated during time reproduction. Lesions in the pars compacta leads to temporal deficits. As of late, the pars compacta has been suspected of regulating the sleep-wake cycle, which is consistent with symptoms such as insomnia and REM sleep disturbances that are reported by patients with Parkinson's disease. Even so, partial dopamine deficits that do not affect motor control can lead to disturbances in the sleep-wake cycle, especially REM-like patterns of neural activity while awake, especially in the hippocampus.\n\n\n## Clinical significance\n\nThe substantia nigra is critical in the development of many diseases and syndromes, including parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease. There exists a study showing that high-frequency stimulation delivery to the left substantia nigra can induce transient acute depression symptoms.\n\n\n### Parkinson's disease\n\nParkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized, in part, by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc. The major symptoms of Parkinson's disease include tremor, akinesia, bradykinesia, and stiffness. Other symptoms include disturbances to posture, fatigue, sleep abnormalities, and depressed mood.\nThe cause of death of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc is unknown. However, some contributions to the unique susceptibility of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta have been identified. For one, dopaminergic neurons show abnormalities in mitochondrial complex 1, causing aggregation of alpha-synuclein; this can result in abnormal protein handling and neuron death. Secondly, dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta contain less calbindin than other dopaminergic neurons. Calbindin is a protein involved in calcium ion transport within cells, and excess calcium in cells is toxic. The calbindin theory would explain the high cytotoxicity of Parkinson's in the substantia nigra compared to the ventral tegmental area. Regardless of the cause of neuronal death, the plasticity of the pars compacta is very robust; Parkinsonian symptoms do not generally appear until  at least 30% of pars compacta dopaminergic neurons have died. Most of this plasticity occurs at the neurochemical level; dopamine transport systems are slowed, allowing dopamine to linger for longer periods of time in the chemical synapses in the striatum.\nMenke, Jbabdi, Miller, Matthews and Zari (2010) used diffusion tensor imaging, as well as T1 mapping to assess volumetric differences in the SNpc and SNpr, in participants with Parkinson's compared to healthy individuals. These researchers found that participants with Parkinson's consistently had a smaller substantia nigra, specifically in the SNpr. Because the SNpr is connected to the posterior thalamus, ventral thalamus and specifically, the motor cortex, and because participants with Parkinson's disease report having a smaller SNprs (Menke, Jbabdi, Miller, Matthews and Zari, 2010), the small volume of this region may be responsible for motor impairments found in Parkinson's disease patients. This small volume may be responsible for weaker and/or less controlled motor movements, which may result in the tremors often experienced by those with Parkinson's.\nOxidative stress and oxidative damage in the SNpc are likely key drivers in the etiology of Parkinson's disease as individuals age.  DNA damages caused by oxidative stress can be repaired by processes modulated by alpha-synuclein.  Alpha synuclein is expressed in the substantia nigra, but its DNA repair function appears to be compromised in Lewy body inclusion bearing neurons.  This loss may trigger cell death.\n\n\n### Schizophrenia\n\nIncreased levels of dopamine have long been implicated in the development of schizophrenia. However, much debate continues to this day surrounding this dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. Despite the controversy, dopamine antagonists remain a standard and successful treatment for schizophrenia. These antagonists include first generation (typical) antipsychotics such as butyrophenones, phenothiazines, and thioxanthenes. These drugs have largely been replaced by second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics such as clozapine and paliperidone. In general, these drugs do not act on dopamine-producing neurons themselves, but on the receptors on the post-synaptic neuron.\nOther, non-pharmacological evidence in support of the dopamine hypothesis relating to the substantia nigra include structural changes in the pars compacta, such as reduction in synaptic terminal size. Other changes in the substantia nigra include increased expression of NMDA receptors in the substantia nigra, and reduced dysbindin expression. Increased NMDA receptors may point to the involvement of glutamate-dopamine interactions in schizophrenia. Dysbindin, which has been (controversially) linked to schizophrenia, may regulate dopamine release, and low expression of dysbindin in the substantia nigra may be important in schizophrenia etiology. Due to the changes to the substantia nigra in the schizophrenic brain, it may eventually be possible to use specific imaging techniques (such as neuromelanin-specific imaging) to detect physiological signs of schizophrenia in the substantia nigra.\n\n\n### Wooden Chest Syndrome\nWooden chest, also called fentanyl chest wall rigidity syndrome, is a rare side effect of synthetic opioids such as Fentanyl, Sulfentanil, Alfentanil, Remifentanil. It results in a generalised increase in skeletal muscle tone. The mechanism is thought to be via increased dopamine release and decreased GABA release in the nerves of the substantia nigra/striatum. The effect is most pronounced on the chest wall muscles and can lead to impaired ventilation. The condition is most commonly observed in anaesthesia where rapid and high doses of these drugs are given intravenously. \n\n\n### Multiple system atrophy\nMultiple system atrophy characterized by neuronal degeneration in the striatum and substantia nigra was previously called striatonigral degeneration.\n\n\n## Chemical modification of the substantia nigra\n\nChemical manipulation and modification of the substantia nigra is important in the fields of neuropharmacology and toxicology. Various compounds such as levodopa and MPTP are used in the treatment and study of Parkinson's disease, and many other drugs have effects on the substantia nigra.\n\n\n### Amphetamine and trace amines\n\nStudies have shown that, in certain brain regions, amphetamine and trace amines increase the concentrations of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, thereby heightening the response of the post-synaptic neuron. The various mechanisms by which amphetamine and trace amines affect dopamine concentrations have been studied extensively, and are known to involve both DAT and VMAT2.  Amphetamine is similar in structure to dopamine and trace amines; as a consequence, it can enter the presynaptic neuron via DAT as well as by diffusing through the neural membrane directly. Upon entering the presynaptic neuron, amphetamine and trace amines activate TAAR1, which, through protein kinase signaling, induces dopamine efflux, phosphorylation-dependent DAT internalization, and non-competitive reuptake inhibition. Because of the similarity between amphetamine and trace amines, it is also a substrate for monoamine transporters; as a consequence, it (competitively) inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and other monoamines by competing with them for uptake, as well.\nIn addition, amphetamine and trace amines are substrates for the neuronal vesicular monoamine transporter, vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). When amphetamine is taken up by VMAT2, the vesicle releases (effluxes) dopamine molecules into the cytosol in exchange.\n\n\n### Cocaine\n\nCocaine's mechanism of action in the human brain includes the inhibition of dopamine reuptake, which accounts for cocaine's addictive properties, as dopamine is the critical neurotransmitter for reward. However, cocaine is more active in the dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area than the substantia nigra. Cocaine administration increases metabolism in the substantia nigra, which can explain the altered motor function seen in cocaine-using subjects. The inhibition of dopamine reuptake by cocaine also inhibits the firing of spontaneous action potentials by the pars compacta. The mechanism by which cocaine inhibits dopamine reuptake involves its binding to the dopamine transporter protein. However, studies show that cocaine can also cause a decrease in DAT mRNA levels, most likely due to cocaine blocking dopamine receptors rather than direct interference with transcriptional or translational pathways.\nInactivation of the substantia nigra could prove to be a possible treatment for cocaine addiction. In a study of cocaine-dependent rats, inactivation of the substantia nigra via implanted cannulae greatly reduced cocaine addiction relapse.\n\n\n### Levodopa\n\nThe substantia nigra is the target of chemical therapeutics for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Levodopa (commonly referred to as L-DOPA), the dopamine precursor, is the most commonly prescribed medication for Parkinson's disease, despite controversy concerning the neurotoxicity of dopamine and L-DOPA. The drug is especially effective in treating patients in the early stages of Parkinson's, although it does lose its efficacy over time. Levodopa can cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and increases dopamine levels in the substantia nigra, thus alleviating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The drawback of levodopa treatment is that it treats the symptoms of Parkinson's (low dopamine levels), rather than the cause (the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra).\n\n\n### MPTP\n\nMPTP, is a neurotoxin specific to dopaminergic cells in the brain, specifically in the substantia nigra. MPTP was brought to the spotlight in 1982 when heroin users in California displayed Parkinson's-like symptoms after using MPPP contaminated with MPTP. The patients, who were rigid and almost completely immobile, responded to levodopa treatment. No remission of the Parkinson's-like symptoms was reported, suggesting irreversible death of the dopaminergic neurons. The proposed mechanism of MPTP involves disruption of mitochondrial function, including disruption of metabolism and creation of free radicals.\nSoon after, MPTP was tested in animal models for its efficacy in inducing Parkinson's disease (with success). MPTP induced akinesia, rigidity, and tremor in primates, and its neurotoxicity was found to be very specific to the substantia nigra pars compacta. In other animals, such as rodents, the induction of Parkinson's by MPTP is incomplete or requires much higher and frequent doses than in primates. Today, MPTP remains the most favored method to induce Parkinson's disease in animal models.\n\n\n## History\n\nThe substantia nigra was discovered in 1784 by F\u00e9lix Vicq-d'Azyr, and Samuel Thomas von S\u00f6mmerring alluded to this structure in 1791. The differentiation between the substantia nigra pars reticulata and compacta was first proposed by Sano in 1910. In 1963, Oleh Hornykiewicz concluded from his observation that \"cell loss in the substantia nigra (of Parkinson's disease patients) could well be the cause of the dopamine deficit in the striatum.\"\n\n\n## Additional images\n\n\n\n## References\n\n\n\n## External links\n\n",
