# Phantom Limbs & Maladaptive Plasticity
Between 60% and 80% of amputees experience phantom limb sensations. Remapping in somatosensory cortex may misattribute activity to the missing limb. Some studies associate phantom limb **pain** specifically with cortical reorganization (maladaptive plasticity), distinguishing it from referred sensations.
