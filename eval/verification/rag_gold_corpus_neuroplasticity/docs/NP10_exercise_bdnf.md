# Exercise, BDNF, and Cognition
Aerobic exercise elevates neurotrophic factors (BDNF, IGF‑1, VEGF) and is associated with improvements in executive function and hippocampal‑dependent memory. Consistent training correlates with increased grey‑matter volume in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus and moderate changes in several other regions.
