# Ganglion_cell


## Introduction


In neurophysiology, a ganglion cell is a cell found in a ganglion (a cluster of neurons in the peripheral nervous system). Depending on their location and function, ganglion cells can be categorized into several major groups:

Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) found in the ganglion cell layer of the retina
Cells that reside in the adrenal medulla, where they are involved in the sympathetic nervous system's release of epinephrine and norepinephrine into the blood stream
Cells of the sympathetic ganglia
Cells of the parasympathetic ganglia
Cells of the spiral ganglia


## General Morphology

During the late 1800s, early 1900s, Spanish Neuroscientist and Pathologist Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal proposed Neuron theory which basically introduced the idea that the Nervous system contained cells called the Neuron. The process he used was called Golgi staining of the vertebrate retina. Cajal was able to differentiate between 
different types of Ganglion cell based on dendritic morphology, cell body and dendritic tree size, and number of sub layers in which they arborize/stratification layers. Through this study, he discovered that the ganglion cell distribution amongst vertebrates were pretty similar minus the Rods and cones in the retinas.
In the 1940s, American Neurologist Stephen Polyak produced description of the Golgi-impregnated Cells that helped further classify types of Ganglion Cells. This data helped scientists get a better understanding of the ganglion cells present in the retinas of Mammals and Primates
In 1974, Boycott and Wassle created a scheme for the classification of Ganglion Cells that was found to be in the cat retina. These cells, alpha, beta, delta and gamma are seen to be linked with the X,Y and W types of physiology. Boycott and Wassle confirmed the idea of Cajal's Ox and Dog retina idea by naming the alpha and beta.
In 1978, the idea of the alpha and beta ganglion cells could be divided into different subgroups, sublamina a and sublamina b. Sublamina a contains dendrite cells containing OFF-center receptive fields while the Sublamina b contains On-center receptive fields.


## Types of Retinal Ganglion Cells

The most studied classes are the parvocellular (P), magnocellular (M), and koniocellular (K) cells, with a fourth class, the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). 
Parvocellular (P) Cells : P-cells make up approximately 70% of all ganglion cells. They are highly concentrated in the fovea. They exhibit center-surround receptive fields and are primarily involved in processing fine spatial detail and color. These cells have high spatial acuity vision and have strong color opponency. However, their temporal resolution is very poor and have low contrast sensitivity.
Magnocellular (M) cells : M-cells contain 10% of the RGCs, and show center-surround receptive fields and is more responsive to changes in luminance and motion. They are crucial for detecting motion and depth because they possess contrast sensitivity and high temporal resolution. In comparison to P cells, Magnocellular (M) cells do not display color opponency, and have much lower spatial resolution.
Koniocellular (K) Cells : K-cells only account for 10% of total ganglion cell population. These cells have irregular receptive field and do not show center-surround feature. They haven't been fully understood yet but are known to be involved in processing blue-yellow color contrast and overall illumination changes. They project in a patchy and disorganized way to the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN). These cells are believed to have a role in motion detection but their exact function is still unknown. 
Intrinsically Photosensitive Retinal Ganglion cells (ipRGCs) : These cells are the fourth type and constitute a different subset of RGCs that contain melanopsin, a photopigment that allows them to respond to light directly without any input from cones or rods. ipRGCs represent non-image forming function functions like sleep-wake cycles, pupillary light reflex, and circadian rhythm regulation. It sends signals to the SCN (suprachiasmatic nucleus) of the hypothalamus through the retinohypothalamic tract. Their photo-transduction mechanism differs from the cone and rod pathways and involves a melanopsin based G-protein cascade and TRP channels.
